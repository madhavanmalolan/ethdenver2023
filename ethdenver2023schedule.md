|Why No One Uses Your dApp: Fixing Onboarding|dApps thrive or starve based on how effective they are at adopting new users, so how you onboard people to your NFT and digital collectable projects matters more than ever. In this technical workshop, senior engineers Brian Cleary & David He will walk us through the landscape of web2-to-web3 adoption, including struggles and opportunities developers are facing. They’ll conclude with instruction and demos using Magic.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|12:10|2023-03-01|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Why No One Uses Your dApp: Fixing Onboarding&dates=20230301T121000Z-07:00/20230301T124000Z-07:00)|

|Making DAO history|I'll take the audience through a brief history of DAOs, showcasing the reason behind some of he industry's key moments. When reaching today, I'll start with contextualizing where we're at and why, providing an evidence-based glimpse of where I think we're headed. Then, will go on to map patterns between the key highlights and the future of DAOs and the tooling for them to thrive.|DAOS + Community Stage|13:00|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Making DAO history&dates=20230302T130000Z-07:00/20230302T132000Z-07:00)|
|Cross-Chain EVM Calls|In this talk we'll discuss how Polkadot's interoperability protocol works at a high level. And we'll go into more details of how this can be used to access Moonbeam's EVM from a different chain. This opens a new realm of possibilities, as contracts in Moonbeam can access app-specialized blockchains inside the Polkadot ecosystem. But also, these specialized chain can tap into Moonbeam's EVM and all the benefits smart contracts offer.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|10:20|2023-02-25|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Cross-Chain EVM Calls&dates=20230225T102000Z-07:00/20230225T104000Z-07:00)|
|MEV Relays: Dumb Pipes or Something More?|Relays are fundamental participants in the current MEV extraction framework, they are responsible for relaying blocks from the block building marketplace to the proposers. However, this role requires more than simply being a dumb pipe facilitating the separation of proposers from builders; their performance and configuration can impact both proposer rewards and network censorship. In this talk, I will provide an in-depth exploration of the operational performance of MEV Relays, including their role and responsibilities in the MEV supply chain. I will also review examples of how different operational performance metrics (such as missed bids, relay latency, and registrations) can affect validator rewards. Lastly, I will discuss the transaction censoring performed by relays in response to OFAC regulations. While in-protocol PBS may eventually eliminate Relays from the MEV supply chain, the on-going impact of their operation should not be ignored.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|17:40|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=MEV Relays: Dumb Pipes or Something More?&dates=20230302T174000Z-07:00/20230302T180000Z-07:00)|

|If Knowledge is Power, What is Zero Knowledge? An Intro to zkVMs|In the past decade, we have seen the rise in popularity of zero-knowledge proof systems along with terminologies that are used to describe them such as STARK, SNARK, PLONK, etc. But what sorts of applications does zk tech actually enable? This talk aims to illuminate what is possible today through zkVM’s and what it means to write programs for them. The focus of this presentation is to describe the features of a zkVM and how developers can use it to build applications on blockchains and beyond!|Bunny Slopes|14:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=If Knowledge is Power, What is Zero Knowledge?

|Where do you belong in Web3?|Many people think Web3 is full of flinty libertarians and Shiba-chasing degens. But anyone who’s hung around crypto for a while knows that the community is pretty diverse — both politically and economically. There are builders, gig workers, leftists, memelords, grannies, and everything in between. In this talk, we’ll finally put some numbers on that diversity, based on a n=5000 ecosystem wide survey of the Web3 ecosystem?.|Bunny Slopes|11:25|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Where do you belong in Web3?&dates=20230303T112500Z-07:00/20230303T114500Z-07:00)|
|How crypto impacts individual psychology|The intersection of psychology, sociology and cryptosystems!

There is a throughline between concepts like
- Private keys
- Personal autonomy
- Regulation and 'protecting users' 
- Social systems that fundamentally trust their users (open networks), versus ones that fundamentally distrust users (governments) 

The proliferation of crypto systems across society allows for values of trust and individual empowerment. Current social structures (oppressive governments) attempt to remove/restrict individual freedom, while crypto systems attempt to restore it. 

What are the broad sociological and psychological impacts of a society built on open and free social structures?|Impact + Public Goods Stage|12:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How crypto impacts individual psychology&dates=20230304T122000Z-07:00/20230304T124000Z-07:00)|

|The challenges of enabling EVM-functionality on Solana blockchain|Blockchain systems Ethereum and Solana are radically different. They differ in terms of architecture and technical implementation. On Solana, for example, parallel execution of transactions is available, but there are restrictions on the number of instructions within a single transaction — which is not the case on Ethereum. The team of Neon Labs overcame a lot of technical hurdles and found a lot of technical tricks to unite Ethereum world with Solana’s. The results of the work done and some of the technical solutions being implemeted will be presented by Marina Guryeva, co-founder and director of Neon Labs.|Main Stage|09:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The challenges of enabling EVM-functionality on Solana blockchain&dates=20230304T090000Z-07:00/20230304T091500Z-07:00)|

|Unlocking Web3 mainstream adoption with hybrid custody and true ownership|Web3 is revolutionizing the Internet by giving users more control and ownership over their data. However, a significant hurdle to its widespread adoption is the absence of clear solutions for managing and owning digital assets. 

This presentation explores the idea of hybrid custody as a solution to this issue. It combines the benefits of centralized and decentralized solutions, providing users with both ease of use and security and transparency and control over their assets. This approach can facilitate a smooth transition for users from the traditional web to Web3 experiences.|Main Stage|10:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Unlocking Web3 mainstream adoption with hybrid custody and true ownership&dates=20230304T100000Z-07:00/20230304T101500Z-07:00)|

|AI's need for Decenralized Compute|ChatGPT has taken the technology world by storm and set a record for the fastest product to cross one million users.  While the ‘death of Google’ or ‘death of search’ is certainly overstated..for now.. the ability for AI to answer questions quickly, thoughtfully, thoroughly and correctly is remarkable.  The next version will undoubtedly be even more powerful and reach tens of millions on its way to billions.  But with this power and reach will come a freight train of scrutiny and controversy.   
As these AI engines mature, they will be seen as a source of truth and every society and government has a view as to what ‘truth’ is regarding certain topics.  The answers to delicate questions are already drawing attention; ChatGPT can the benefits of green energy but some users have found it hard to get answers for ‘the benefits of carbon based energy’.  What would it have answered about masking in 2020 when Fauci didn’t recommend it? Would that answer be the same in late 2020 when the CDC strongly recommended masking for everyone?  The sensitivities get even greater in countries with even more charged topics such as in India or Pakistan not to mention with the totalitarian regimes that enforce a particular narrative.  We have already seen the US government’s interest in supporting or limiting certain topics on Twitter and a single source of truth will be even more threatening to governments, politicians and even communities. 
How can a company or organization possibly manage all of the competing demands regarding particular answers?  We can expect AI engines to be banned in some countries, but where it isn’t banned, it certainly will be the subject of regulation which will erode its credibility and likely will reduce the scope of topics it can address. 
The first step in reducing company or government influence is an open source AI engine where a community can train the model transparently, and several projects like Bloom and EleutherAI are already in progress.  But training is just the beginning; no matter the inputs, scrutiny will be on the outputs and any organization running the model will be subject to pressure.   The only inoculation from this pressure is to decentralize the actual running of the AI engine by hosting it on a global decentralized network with no owners and no single points of control.  Run on a decentralized network, any storage provider can host the model and any compute provider can process queries. 
The good news is the technology already exists to make this a reality but how will it be implemented and by whom?  And will an uncensored version be good? What are the drawbacks?
The future will likely see multiple AI engines competing to be the source of truth, and that is healthy.  Linux provides a good example of how the global community can build a powerful alternative to centralized companies and the same may happen with AI but as important as building/training the AI.. is the running of it.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|14:00|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=AI's need for Decenralized Compute&dates=20230302T140000Z-07:00/20230302T142000Z-07:00)|

|The VC Perspective on Web3 in 2023|The idea of a truly decentralized web has only been around since 2009, and this turning point is one of immense opportunity – to combine the democratizing forces of blockchain with the stability of institutions and hypercharge growth in the Web3 ecosystem. Yet, the sentiment around Web3 from institutions isn’t always clear or positive. 

In this panel, Andy will host a discussion with top VCs from Pantera Capital, Paradigm, and Jump Crypto, to share their expertise, knowledge, and personal opinions around Web3 through an investing lens. The panel will act as a resource for founders and fellow investors to gain insight into what investors look for in Web3 investments, the most interesting investments they’ve seen recently, traits of companies they’ve seen lead to success and failure, and what Web3 investments will look like in the next year and beyond.|Decentralized Finance Stage|12:05|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The VC Perspective on Web3 in 2023&dates=20230303T120500Z-07:00/20230303T123000Z-07:00)|

|How decentralized protocols are revolutionizing today's data infrastructure and the distributed web|It's not about web2 vs. web3. Rather, Web3 represents an inevitable evolution of where humanity currently stands with the latest version of the web(Web2).

One of the most significant areas where Web3 is making a mark is in the realm of cloud data infrastructure. The talk will delve in to how decentralized protocols such as IPFS are revolutionizing today's data infrastructure and the distributed web. The new ways of interacting with data are not only transforming the way we store and access data, but also challenging our preconceived notions of the internet and its capabilities by breaking down the data and identity silos.

As a result, there is a paradigm shift in the way we interact with the internet, with a more open, decentralized, and trustless experience for all.  Are we there yet? 

Just as with many other areas of technological development, it takes years of iteration and improvement to reach the key milestones in history. And in the same way, while we have come a long way, there's still a long way to go. This is part of the journey!|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|13:50|2023-03-01|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How decentralized protocols are revolutionizing today's data infrastructure and the distributed web&dates=20230301T135000Z-07:00/20230301T141000Z-07:00)|

|Blockchain Ethics: Ethereum, Web3, and Decentralized Morality|As blockchain becomes more impactful in the world, our obligation to make sure that we are proceeding in a responsible manner increases. But what does a responsible future look like? In order to help answer this question, my talk will dive into the history of ethical issues within Ethereum (for example, the tensions between personal liberty and harmful actions, or "code is law" violations) and use these as a foundation to present one way (a more formal way) of considering these issues. Then, following in the footsteps of, e.g., bioethics or AI ethics, I'll share a framework for "blockchain ethics" before ending with a note on the future of ethics and responsibility in the Ethereum ecosystem.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|11:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Blockchain Ethics: Ethereum, Web3, and Decentralized Morality&dates=20230303T112000Z-07:00/20230303T114000Z-07:00)|
|Experimenting With DAOs and NFTs|The main focus of this talk will be on experimenting in DAOs -- specifically DAOs that use NFTs to govern and/or gate their community. I will pull examples from podcasts like Rehash and Mint, which have both released podcast NFTs for purchase, as well as up and coming DAO communities that have experimented with some novel ideas over the last year, such as Rehash and Newt (Aave). I will highlight both the successes and failures of these experiments and share my analysis of why certain experiments succeeded while others failed. I'll conclude the talk with an actionable game plan DAO contributors can follow if they're interested in experimenting in their NFT-driven DAO.

I believe this is an important topic to include at ETH Denver 2023 because there is no better time than a bear market to experiment. Everything is low(er) stakes, which makes it less scary and disastrous to experiment and fail. This is the best time for us to try new things and learn from our wins and losses so that when the next bull market comes around, the DAOs and communities that make it until then will have such a stronger foundation than a newer community that got its start in the bull market.|DAOS + Community Stage|09:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Experimenting With DAOs and NFTs&dates=20230304T094000Z-07:00/20230304T100000Z-07:00)|

|Help! Developers want to use my stuff - How to build a Web3 SDK|There's plenty of information out there on how to *use* Web3 libraries that connect to Smart Contracts. But how do you *build* one? In this workshop we'll go over best practices and helpful tools that will make developers love your library.
We'll look at examples and discuss API choices as well as the fact how freakishly important well written and up-to-date documentation is.

|Blockchain is powering financial inclusion for excluded communities in Africa.|I'd like to talk about the role that decentralized finance is playing in Africa and how it can shape the future and empower millions out of poverty. I believe that DeFi has the power to shape a new and improved financial operating system for Africa that is both accessible and affordable for the 400 million unbanked. In turn, this provides more Africans with the opportunity to access credit for both personal and business related loans which can power economic growth and ignite innovations at a grassroots level that we’ve never seen before. In summary, my contribution would be an exploration of present and future pathways of DeFi in Africa with tangible examples that help bring this vision to life for the audience.|Decentralized Finance Stage|14:30|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Blockchain is powering financial inclusion for excluded communities in Africa.&dates=20230304T143000Z-07:00/20230304T150000Z-07:00)|

|Bridging the World to Web3|In this fireside chat, Will Robinson, VP of Engineering at Coinbase will discuss how industry leaders are focused on connecting the world of blockchain to the rest of the world.

His goal is to make blockchain tools so easy and simple to use that any startup or developer thinks about how to build their business and products on chain, by default. 

Join Will as he shares the main challenges Coinbase is trying to solve for web3 developers.

The fireside chat will discuss the different challenges faced by web3 developers today and how industry leaders are working towards solving them. 

One of the hallmarks of a true developer platform is that it brings tremendous value outside of the business. Which is why Coinbase is focused on building a launch pad for a thriving web3 ecosystem. Ethereum developers are a crucial part of this mission. 

In order to bridge the web2 and web3 worlds, we need a thriving developer economy across a diverse number of industries.

There is a real challenge in effectively scaling models in a robust and predictable manner using composable modules. One technique that allows for composable incentive modelling is called Compositional Game Theory. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how scalable models can be composed of "open games", and how this allows for the robust incentive design of complex systems.

|Moving Past the Ashes of FTX: A conversation on DeFi Policy Going Forward|In 2022, the Senate Agriculture Committee put forth the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA). The initial draft legislation included overly broad definitions that could be interpreted to capture DeFi protocols, developers, and other market participants, and would have imposed unworkable obligations originally designed for centralized businesses. This was due, in part, to a lack of understanding, resulting in zero distinction between DeFi and its centralized counterparts. 

FTX was a major backer of the bill, meeting with Congress to see its implementation. Its collapse caught both policymakers and regulators off-guard, resulting in renewed calls for swift action. 

In 2023, a new Congress will take their seats and will need to address the fallout from this debacle. The Blockchain Association is working to educate Congress so that Members can clearly distinguish the events of FTX from the broader crypto ecosystem.

|Account Abstraction and its use cases|The panel would be on the topic of Account Abstraction and its use cases. The goal for the panel would not be so much to discuss technical details, but rather what use cases it can unlock and how it can drive further innovation and adoption.

How can account abstraction be a catalyst for mainstream adoption? By bringing together representatives from diverse projects and organizations, this panel would aim to discuss some of the use cases not only to lay out in practical terms what account abstraction technology can enable, but also to get the community excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and that are already available.

As such, we're trying to bring together diverse use cases of account abstraction with our speakers: Argent (wallet), XLA/XSolla (gaming), Visa (mainstream payments) and us, zkSync (for scaling).

Suggested topics to be covered in on the panel:

- What is AA?
- Why has interest/noise/momentum around AA been accelerating recently?
- What possibilities does AA open? What problems does it solve?
- What are the applications of AA in the ecosystem: finance, gaming, etc.
- Specific to Devs: how can they get involved, what resources are available.

|Build web3 startups in sectors outside your expertise.|This is an interesting dilemma that stops countless entrepreneurs. So let me tell you how I overcame this obstacle.

I went to medical school because my Asian parents thought that was the best for me & my happiness. One thing led to another, I dropped out of medical school. Then my parents somewhat disowned me so I moved out of my parents. (I'm from Sri Lanka and I don't know only a few who moved out of their parents, so this is quite a bid deal) 

Then I started one startup, and it failed, 
another, it failed, 
Another, again a failure, and Metana; worked!

How, this is what I'm going to talk about. It started at ethdenver 2021. Ups & downs, from my co-founder ditching me in the middle of Denver in heavy snow to being stuck in Chicago airport & our first instructor threatening me to give the company or else he'll screw me, to hiring people & the overall hustle. It's a ride. Love to tell all this in the place where I started my company. 

Remember these? - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wLjdqBoOw5c6abHaXCX-WE0MpQ1hkd-J?usp=share_link
This is how I validated Metana in last year's ethdenver.

We have not raised additional money, despite the constant pressure of feeling like that is a bad idea. We have had plenty of people and groups wanting to own a piece of the company, but I just can’t get past the feeling that everyone is just “playing start-up”.

I tell early-stage people all the time, to focus on building a business. The product, the idea, and the business plan they want you to write are meaningless if you’re not cashing checks. Find something that creates value that someone else is willing to pay you for, focus on that and everything else will fall into place!|Bunny Slopes|11:45|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Build web3 startups in sectors outside your expertise.&dates=20230304T114500Z-07:00/20230304T120000Z-07:00)|

|Incentivize what matters: How Decentralized Incentivized APIs will build the Decentralized Public Cloud|The talk argues that APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a critical component for abstracting open-source software and connecting middleware, making them a key component in modern software stacks for both web2 apps and web3 dApps. The growth of Linux led to the rise of open-source software and APIs, and startups and investors moved from proprietary software to open core + SaaS business models. Public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have transformed corporate IT by providing elastic compute, storage, and communication services, but they have also monetized open-source software by layering their own proprietary SaaS stacks on top. This has gutted the open-source startup model, as the open core OSS feeds directly into the cloud provider's revenue instead of the teams who find, build, and maintain the open core portion of the OSS.

The talk suggests that decentralized incentivized APIs, a tool from blockchain technology, can change this by including decentralized metering and billing as integral features of APIs, allowing for the reconstruction of public clouds in the full image of decentralization. Similar to how gas is used for Ethereum transactions, layer 1 API metering and billing can be trustless machine-to-machine APIs that run in payment state channels coupled to the underlying TCP 1:1 communication. Layer 2 metering and billing systems can be as rich or richer than existing centralized cloud providers, with different forms of freemium and premium business models. The talk suggests that this model should spread throughout the decentralized cloud services model, driving the monetization of OSS and feeding back to accelerating its development. It aims for a multi-protocol and multi-participant world with many datacenters running the DPC (decentralized public cloud) stack and providing services through many protocols and decentralized protocols with their dAPIs.|Main Stage|14:10|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Incentivize what matters: How Decentralized Incentivized APIs will build the Decentralized Public Cloud&dates=20230303T141000Z-07:00/20230303T143000Z-07:00)|

|HodlerCon: a Layer Zero Decentralized Vacation|2022 was a momentous year for Ethereum’s Layer 1 and the Merge. But there was another reason to celebrate. In Waikiki, internet friends met for decentralized vacation on Layer 0 at HodlerCon. 

Members from Reddit’s r/ethfinance, r/ethstaker, r/ethtrader and the Rocketpool discord have built a community and relationships online for years across different time zones and walks of life. We huddled together through the crypto winter of 2018-2020 and promised each other if ETH hit it’s all time high by June 2021.  We’d celebrate in real life, by basking on the beaches of Hawaii together. 

It happened! ETH hit a new all time high, and the ETHfam followed through with Hodlercon. We packed our bags gathered our families, friends, and partners to meet our internet friends. The people who had reminded us to hold, or to build or to appreciate what matters most in life through the dark times. During HodlerCon, we had a blast singing karaoke, riding ATVs, eating Ramen, exchanging POAPs, swimming on the beach and nerding out with people who understood us. 

We’re doing it again in 2024 and are using Hodlercon-issued BeachBums nfts to vote on the potential destinations from Goblintown Creek, VA, Puerto Rico or Fiji. The final destination to be determination made by ETH’s price on June 15, 2023. 

Our panel will describe how a ragtag group pulled together a 10-day decentralized vacation, incorporated a DAO, handled participants privacy and anonymity, issued NFTs, hired and fired event planners, got people excited without being shilly. We have kept momentum up for the next event. We hope the audience will first enjoy the discussion and second consider helping us build the next Hodlercon for 2024.

|Why are cross-chain auctions so hard?|One of the unsung heroes of the cryptocurrency space is the humble auction. Auctions rule many things in DeFi, consensus, and NFTs, with everything from MEV auctions at Flashbots to on-chain NFT auctions relying on this core mechanism. As Ethereum evolves to have to handle multiple domains (e.g. many L2s and rollups), the set of auctions that users and developers have to interact with is set to grow dramatically. There have even been proposals (e.g. Proposer-Builder separation) to add auctions directly to the main protocol. But how safe, hard, and/or challenging will this increase in auction complexity be? 

In this talk, we'll talk about the nature of auctions in the cryptocurrency space and provide some examples for how the auction landscape will change in the coming months and will impact everything from the economics to the UX of the chain. We'll focus on how cross-chain auctions will become ubiquitous (based on the current Ethereum roadmap) and discuss some of the challenges with the design and implementation of such auctions. We'll end with a description of some new mathematical results that can help influence how protocol and application developers interact with auctions.|Decentralized Finance Stage|10:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Why are cross-chain auctions so hard?&dates=20230304T104000Z-07:00/20230304T110000Z-07:00)|

|Designing the Emotional Ergonomics of Cyberspace|Welcome to the weird wild web—a place previously constrained by carefully designed and rigorously A/B tested user journeys leading you to anything and everything all of the time…as long as it’s served up with a side of algorithmically targeted ads. We’ve learned a few lessons from web2, and as we’re building the frontiers of this next iteration of the internet, what are the navigational tools we'll need to explore the cyberspace that we’ve uncovered so far? 

If the Industrial Era needed physical ergonomics to make our machines easier to use, and the Information Era needed UI/UX to make data more ergonomic to our brains and become human readable, in this next age where we exist in cyberphysical realities, what are the emotional ergonomics we need to navigate an increasingly chaotic system of financial and information exchange? As the internet entangles more of our daily lives, what interactions will help soothe the chaotic patterns that algorithms send towards us? The skeuomorphic phase of web2 helped ground digital interactions in physical metaphors, but as web3 introduces new capabilities that are digitally native, what are the metaphors that help us make sense of the intuitive interactions that both delight communities and are easy to adopt?

In an ecosystem with the collective power to shift economies of value, how do we start to design for attention as the scarcest resource? In a spacetime where our daily rituals involve bowing our heads to look into palm sized digital sanctuaries, what is our technological theology? What if we could associate smells with our seed phrases to help us remember them? What if we could feel the size of a transaction being processed? This hands on workshop hosted by an interaction designer and Harvard lecturer takes you on a multisensorial field trip to explore these questions and more—holding up a mirror to reflect collectively on what we’ll need to build the internet we’ve hyped.

Bring your bodies and your senses—we'll be co-creating the first draft of "Interactions for a Multi-sensorial Internet: An Interaction Design Toolkit for Web3" (and brand and rename it to something more catchy) and work towards launching it as a public good throughout 2023.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|15:50|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Designing the Emotional Ergonomics of Cyberspace&dates=20230304T155000Z-07:00/20230304T162000Z-07:00)|
|Defeating Big-Login with Sign-In with Ethereum|The talk covers how we enter a world where the login becomes "unbundled" due to web3, and instead of users logging into platforms, platforms now have to log into users' data vaults. Today, identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or Apple manage the entire login experience, but so much more can be unlocked by unbundling: user control, data sharing, and faster innovation. A single organization should not have the sole discretion as to what kinds of data sharing are supported for billions of people, especially if they have interests competing with those of their users.  If Google ever decided to shut down your account, you wouldn't just lose access to Google services, but you would also lose access to everything you've signed into using your Google account. It all starts with users logging in using their wallets and owning their own identifiers -- one that doesn't require consent from a large tech provider, and that's what Sign-In with Ethereum brings to life.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|15:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Defeating Big-Login with Sign-In with Ethereum&dates=20230304T152000Z-07:00/20230304T154000Z-07:00)|

|Security and ZK-Rollups - No compromise approach to scaling Ethereum.|As the number of ecosystem projects grows, and more users and TVL flows to Web3, so do notorious actors including hackers. The more the Ethereum ecosystem grows the more is at stake in terms assets to be lost/stolen and the reputational damage it can cause.

In parallel we’ve seen a faster than expected innovation in the Ethereum scaling space, particularly zero-knowledge proofs, which have been touted by Vitalik himself as the end-game for scaling Ethereum.

The very decentralized nature of blockchain technology requires us to rethink how security is approached. In order to deploy a technology to the community as a public good, the stakes are high and many different actors need to be involved if we want to ensure that all technology that is shipped is as secure as possible. If the community will ultimately be the guardians of a protocol, the ecosystem players need to ensure that code is securely developed and that all precautions have been taken.

This talk aims to bring several important actors around the table to discuss how security should be approached for scaling Ethereum with a specific focus on zero-knowledge proofs which have seen massive advancements over the last year.|Main Stage|13:30|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Security and ZK-Rollups - No compromise approach to scaling Ethereum.&dates=20230303T133000Z-07:00/20230303T135000Z-07:00)|

|How Zero Knowledge Technology will Revolutionize Web3|In 2015, the Ethereum protocol proposed a vision for a decentralized world computer capable of rearchitecting a free and open internet – removed from the whims and constraints of centralized entities. While Ethereum has become the foundation for Web3 as we know it, its growth was underscored by the upgrades that would be required to realize its full potential. 

As a result, layer 2 has emerged as clear front-runners in the race to scale the network for mass adoption. Solutions using zero knowledge (ZK) technologies are among the most promising – and their potential isn’t limited to scaling. 

ZK-powered technology is expected to revolutionize myriad sectors from gaming to payments, and from digital identity to enterprise solutions. Looking ahead, 2023 promises to be the year ZK tech truly starts to take off.

|What's ahead for DODO - DODO V3|DODO realizes its mission after a year of upheaval in the crypto markets is to continue building and bringing new products that give our users more freedom and security.

The projects that drove the hype cycle preceding the current bear market did not bring any major innovations to DeFi’s technological layer. To determine which platforms will last—and what DeFi’s future will look like—we need to note which projects focus less on novel tokenomics and get back to innovating at the technological layer. Join Mark Wang for a discussion on the next step for DODO-DODO v3, and how it would help bring innovation to the DEFI space.|Decentralized Finance Stage|19:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=What's ahead for DODO - DODO V3&dates=20230303T190000Z-07:00/20230303T192000Z-07:00)|

|The Three Pillars of Sustainability for Blockchain|We’re putting forward Marieke Flament, as a community speaker at ETHDenver 2023. Marieke will speak about the three pillars of sustainability for blockchains and her efforts to promote these values at NEAR.

The three pillars of sustainability:
Diversity - Representation across the spectrum in all subsets of society - race, age, socio-economic background, gender - is key for the adoption and development of blockchains. Hiring decisions should be made with inclusion in mind, to ensure that the development of blockchains is influenced by all demographics and accessible for everyone.  Diversity can also be achieved  by breaking down barriers to tech development by supporting easier to use building applications like java in web3, creating communities to help attract and retain talent, and to actively  promote online training and education. 

The Environment - Considerations for the preservation of our surroundings are key across all industries, but getting it right is even more important for blockchains as they are adopted across sectors. From leading the charge in promoting a proof of stake method over proof of work to leverage blockchain technology for projects that help to preserve and repair our ecosystem, Web3 has an important role to play in saving the planet. 

Ethics - The traditional approach to achieving a higher ethical standard in an industry is through government regulation that offers checks and balances. Blockchains, however,  don’t really need regulation for they are the solution to ethical shortfalls due to their inherent transparency as a visible ledger. Decentralisation is the way forward - but convincing the sceptics could become the biggest challenge to overcome in 2023 given recent scandals. But the fight to clean up the industry is a battle that must be fought. 

Marieke Flament and the NEAR foundation have employed these three pillars to drive impressive growth in the NEAR ecosystem - and she would like to share her experiences with the audience. The NEAR blockchain recently surpassed 250 million transactions and the ecosystem is now the home of over 1000 projects, ranging from Web3 gaming to Music NFTs - one of which was nominated for a Grammy award. NEAR’s success in 2022 - which saw 15x growth in the number of accounts - was a product of building with the three pillars of sustainability at the forefront of each team’s decision making. She can talk about how this was achieved, the lessons she’s learned and what to expect in 2023.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|12:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Three Pillars of Sustainability for Blockchain&dates=20230303T120000Z-07:00/20230303T122000Z-07:00)|

|Permissionlessly connecting the modular future|The modular blockchain thesis allows for the lightweight, programmatic creation of blockchains. The future of crypto will be “hyper-chain” where every application protocol will have its own application-specific modular environment—whether it be an app-chain or an app-rollup. The missing piece to this modular future is liquidity. To date, no modular blockchain solution has solved the issue of connecting liquidity from one modular instance to another. It's a major deterrent to the vision of a modular future with millions of application-specific environments.

This hyper-chain world must converge on one simple, sustainable, and secure liquidity layer that connects all these disparate environments together permissionlessly. Every new application-specific environment will have automatic liquidity connected to other environments through a brand new primitive called Catalyst.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|10:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Permissionlessly connecting the modular future&dates=20230304T104000Z-07:00/20230304T110000Z-07:00)|

|Designing for Multiplayer Mode|Web3 is a uniquely platform-agnostic world. Switching costs are much lower. Designing for experiences that amplify the value of people's relationships is one way to make people stay. It's the community in the NFTs and Culture space that gives the project its value, not the product alone. 

How might we build experiences that engage the collective? Where does product design begin and end when your KPIs are the ripple effects of a social phenomenon?

How can we amplify the value of human relationships through product roadmaps that focus on innovating social patterns through new forms of governance, stakeholdership, and community creativity?

These are some questions I'd like to ask. In addition I'd like to discuss some design tenants that are important when we speak of design for the social world:
1) Designing with intimacy as a value
> using slow design to create moments of stillness, connection, etc. Diametrically opposed to the ecommerce patterns of one-click funnel fantasia!
2) Architecting the Metagame
> building a gamified social layer on top of any interactive experience that in some way provides upward social mobility for the participants.
3) Evoking the "Spellbound"
> crafting experiences that inspire, and above all elicit emotions.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|14:15|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Designing for Multiplayer Mode&dates=20230303T141500Z-07:00/20230303T144000Z-07:00)|
|Cypherpunk Beginnings and The Argument for Proof of Work|With Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake there is a common mainstream perception that Proof of Work is an "old technology" with no redeeming merits, forever assigned to the dustbin of history with The Merge.

I would like to take the audience back to the very beginnings of the blockchain revolution.  Back to Bitcoin basics and cypher-punk origins.  How did we get to where we are?   As part of that, the speaker will enumerate the ways in which POW and POS are similar and dissimilar, and ways in which POW is superior to POS systems.

It is likely that many people in the blockchain ecosystem in 2022 were not around in this early phase and might never have heard some of these origin stories.  People who might never have considered Bitcoin to have any merits over Ethereum.

This will be a devil's advocate talk which should be intellectually stimulating and an interesting counterpoint to accepted mainstream positions on POW and POS.|Bunny Slopes|09:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Cypherpunk Beginnings and The Argument for Proof of Work&dates=20230303T090000Z-07:00/20230303T092000Z-07:00)|

|The Longest Internet Shutdown In History:  Surviving a Hidden Genocide in 2022|You likely don’t know about the Tigray War of 2020-2023. The reality is a small group of psychopaths in Addis Ababa spent billions to make sure you don’t. Rug their investment! - come learn about the longest internet shutdown in history and the radical tools being used to disrupt and dismantle the digital imperialism of the Ethiopian Empire.

This talk will present 2 years of intense hard fought research about the state-sponsored internet blackout against civilian populations in Ethiopia - using Tigray as the main case study. 

With that foundation, we'll look at the crucial roles of blockchains in the Tigray war. How they’re used by the Federal State to effectively track refugees and hunt survivors - while in contrast, Tigrayan civilians use crypto to circumvent the total banking shutdown. The people of Tigray have withstood the longest total siege in modern history and weaponized internet access played a crucial role in maintaining their oppression. Disconnecting Tigray ensured the people lost their ability to represent themselves to the world. When a central authority like the Ethiopian Regime, has the power to deny its victims their rightful voice on the global stage, that authority is now free to abandon all humanity - genocide happens in the dark.

Come workshop with Tigray Internet Freedom DAO - learn about multi-ethnic federalism and how cypherpunk tools are the only way to ensure Tigray is never dark again. 

You might think: “But it’s Ethiopia, that's far away. Why would I care about that??”

Here’s why bestie: Weaponized internet access in 2023 is more of an existential threat to Western cypherpunks than anything else. There exist enough infrastructure options that an effective shutdown is highly unlikely. So the concept of a “weaponized internet blackout” becomes a boogeyman idea rather than an active human rights threat. Consequently, this ideological comfort means you’re all getting soft. Can any of you really say what it’s like living inside a weaponized internet blackout - overwhelmingly no. 

However, In Tigray Ethiopia, the longest weaponized internet shutdown in history has just BARELY started to lift. As journalists and humanitarians trickle in - the aftermath of the Tigray Region serves as a terrifying testament to the reality of a state-sponsored internet blackout. A reality that should motivate cypherpunks in the West to immediately shake themselves from their comfort - because the 2-year-long internet blackout was endorsed and partially funded by Western governments. They took notes, you should too.|DAOS + Community Stage|11:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Longest Internet Shutdown In History:  Surviving a Hidden Genocide in 2022&dates=20230303T110000Z-07:00/20230303T112000Z-07:00)|

|Stablecoins and Liquid Staking Tokens: Why they're more similar than different|The Ethereum liquid staking ecosystem has experienced rapid growth during the buildup to the Merge and the Shanghai upgrade. This has led to the introduction of new liquid staking tokens, each with their own unique models for ensuring sustainable and fruitful yields. Yet at its crux, the success of liquid staking tokens is dependent on maintaining a 1-to-1 value with ETH.

This talk intends to explore the different types of liquid staking providers and their respective tokens such as stETH, rETH, and Frax’s own frxETH. Drawing on his experience designing Frax’s native stablecoin FRAX which holds a consistent peg, Sam will explain why the best way to design a liquid staking token is to use a stablecoin mechanism design.|Decentralized Finance Stage|15:30|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Stablecoins and Liquid Staking Tokens: Why they're more similar than different&dates=20230304T153000Z-07:00/20230304T155000Z-07:00)|
|How NFTs are Revolutionizing DAO Finance|NFTs are not just JPEGs – they are a new financial primitive that will transform how DAOs (and crypto projects in general) fundraise, operate, and get acquired. Through recent developments, DAOs can now wrap their native tokens into NFTs and borrow against them, unlocking a new form of financing previously closed off to them – private debt. Why does this matter? Because private debt enables direct lending at the DAO level, so DAOs don’t have to rely on venture capital or selling more tokens anymore. Private debt is non-dilutive, is the third largest private market behind VC and PE (valued at $1.2 trillion), and will usher in a new class of investors that grows the crypto ecosystem as a whole.|DAOS + Community Stage|15:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How NFTs are Revolutionizing DAO Finance&dates=20230303T152000Z-07:00/20230303T154000Z-07:00)|

|The Family Fork: Support for moms, dads, and families in web3|Are you a mom or dad who is passionate about web3 but wishes there was more support for you to fully contribute? From earning enough income through DAO contributions to childcare at conferences, many collaborators we work with are silently struggling to balance their passion for web3 with the needs of their family.    

As the web3 space evolves, DAOs become more mature and tooling gets better, our hope is that support for contributors with families will also evolve. We at FamilyDAO are committed to supporting families in Web3 and beyond. 

Members of FamilyDAO, who also work across DAOs and at jobs in web3, will discuss how they and others are navigating web3 as a parent and share their strategies for cobbling together support.  We will also spend a little time talking about pixel art, NFT auctions and DAO governance that have been designed to support FamilyDAO and our mission.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|16:05|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Family Fork: Support for moms, dads, and families in web3&dates=20230302T160500Z-07:00/20230302T162500Z-07:00)|
|Outlook of metaverse in next 5 years|The metaverse is based on human-centered experiences, including personal digital identities, social interactions, and daily immersive experiences. It is not a game, but a virtual space of online and offline value exchange. The metaverse is a sustainable ecosystem. The Internet of Things, Networking and Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence are both well established and dominated by large players that control most of the market share, leaving few investment opportunities for newcomers. The next three sectors — interactive technology, gaming, and blockchain — are more suitable for players to enter and invest. And it is within these three sectors that the Metaverse will truly find it's feet within the coming 5 years.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|16:15|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Outlook of metaverse in next 5 years&dates=20230304T161500Z-07:00/20230304T164500Z-07:00)|
|The Current State of Fully On-Chain Games|There are games that try to put their state (and the logic that executes changes to that state) on chain. The most famous example is Dark Forest (2021), which remains quite esoteric, since the UX was meant for only the bravest of users. The hope is that in making games fully permissionless, trustless, open-source and composable, we will see the emergence of new design patterns. In the same way that Uniswap was able to put swaps fully on chain and integrate with other protocols in novel ways (such as with Flash Loans), fully on-chain gaming threatens to produce a sea-change. In this talk, I trace the progress that developers have made in bringing games from web2.5 to the web3. Not only have their been scaling and tooling problems, but there have also been design problems. In the same way that AMM had to reimagine swapping away from order books, on-chain games are similarly exploring niche genres of gaming that are appropriate for the asynchronicity of the blockchain.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|17:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Current State of Fully On-Chain Games&dates=20230303T172000Z-07:00/20230303T174000Z-07:00)|
|Improving Financial Inclusion Through Affordable Credit Access|Access to affordable credit has been identified by the Federal Reserve and United Nations as a key driver of economic mobility and component of financial inclusion. Yet, countless individuals world wide do not have access to affordable credit. A third of American adults could not afford a $1,000 emergency expense. So, if their car breaks down for instance and they need it to go to work they may be forced into a position where they take out a high-interest loan. High-interest consumer loans are a $70 billion market in the United States alone. Within this market payday loans are particularly egregious with average interest rates of 390%. Despite these high-interest rates 12 million Americans on average will take one out every year. Congress in the past has attempted to regulate this market out of existence, but has failed to do so. It is clear a market solution is needed. Ethereum and other blockchains provide the perfect medium for building a solution to this high-interest lending crisis. They are highly transparent and accessible anywhere in the world. Furthermore, they can help solve some of the biggest issues that cause this market to exist such as information asymmetry.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|10:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Improving Financial Inclusion Through Affordable Credit Access&dates=20230304T100000Z-07:00/20230304T102000Z-07:00)|
|A Borderless World|"Globalism" made the world smaller. The pandemic accelerated the predominance of remote-first work. Then as countries began opening their borders, people realized they could take their laptop and work from anywhere. Some countries have started to catch on and try to attract global nomads with special visas, but most countries are leaving money on the table as these work-tourists work remotely.

Opolis is building a global public utility infrastructure for employment that benefits both nomads and the jurisdictions they temporarily call "home." By facilitating payroll and tax withholding, Opolis can ensure the correct amount of tax is withheld and directed to the appropriate state, local, and federal tax jurisdictions. This optimization of tax payments can lower the barrier to obtaining digital nomad visas, and should lead to a proliferation thereof.

The future of work is borderless and permissionless. This panel will gather experts to discuss taxes, payroll, remittances, visas, travel and what a Web3-powered future could look like, as well as what steps could be taken to buidl a world in which people and money can flow freely.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|11:30|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=A Borderless World&dates=20230302T113000Z-07:00/20230302T115500Z-07:00)|

|#ShareTheMEV: Recirculating value to all the right places|Since the Merge, MEV has emerged as a more foundational force in the Ethereum network. Today, the value MEV produces flows away from the transaction originators that creates the opportunity - end users, dapps, wallets, and more. That does not need to be the case. 

Block Builders now have the opportunity to take recirculation of value into consideration when building blocks. Instead of giving the proceeds from MEV all to the validator, they can instead choose to share it with the transaction originators. Practically speaking, this could ultimately result in a future where your Ethereum wallet pays you to use it in the form of MEV rebates and/or tokens associated with the transactions you conduct. 

This talk will take a dive deep into how block building sets the stage for #sharethemev, how exactly it may impact you, and what you can do today as a transaction originator to prepare for this future.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|09:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=#ShareTheMEV: Recirculating value to all the right places&dates=20230303T092000Z-07:00/20230303T094000Z-07:00)|
|The Need for Seamless New User Onboarding for Broader Web3 Adoption|Web3 & DeFi adoption has been slow as new users struggle entering the complex new world filled with different ways of working, unique nomenclature and poor user experiences. For many new users, purchasing their first cryptocurrency is already a difficult task. However, to meaningfully engage in the Web3 world, cryptocurrencies and dApps - users need to learn about blockchains, tokens, L2 & L3 layers, swapping, bridging, gas fees and so much more. In other words, entering Web3 for your average new user is far too challenging today.

|User Centric UX Design for DAOs|We have been building the DAO ecosystem for a few years now. Especially after 2020-21 it seems like everyone has a DAO. Social gatherings, charities, big products and small ideas - everything can be coordinated by a DAO. Yet, while extremely powerful structure, Decentralized Autonomous Organisations are only gaining traction in our web3 bubble. Given that no one needs to convince anyone to running their code Open Source, and Open Source can be considered grandparents of DAOs, it is surprising how little general adoption we have. 
My theory is that we got so swept away with setting up DAOs, we forgot about the basic principles behind any successful product today - start with User Centric Design and build things that people are dying to use. As an expert in UCD, I would like to lead a workshop where we work on better UX for DAOs.

|Beyond Account Abstraction - Better Experiences and Safety using Cryptography|Most of us Web3 folks can agree that “Accounts” - how end-users identify on and utilize Web3 networks - need to improve if we’re ever going to approach mainstream adoption. With Externally-Owned Accounts (EOAs), Web3 introduced unprecedented agency and sovereignty to users. The cost, however, was a lot of responsibility: one single key, one single point-of-failure. Lose your key, lose your crypto, and that’s it. 
Recently, a lot of discussions have circled around Account Abstraction, or using smart contracts to decouple “accounts” - an end-user’s digital assets and interactions - from signing. Smart contract Account Abstraction provides a ton of advantages for users, including reducing that single point of failure, improving security, and enabling more sophisticated programmed functionality. 
Smart Contract Account Abstraction is not without its compromises though. Code and engineering risk, interactivity with other dApps, inter-network operability and portability, and affordability, amongst others, would suffer as a result. 
In this presentation, we’d like to explore what’s Beyond Account Abstraction, and what opportunities we have to employ leading-edge cryptography and infrastructure to achieve the same - or better - features for end-users without such substantial compromises. We’ll introduce and apply concepts like secure multiparty computation (SMPC), various threshold signature schemes, and key resharing to externally-owned accounts, as well as discuss their advantages and disadvantages. 
At the end of the day, we’re all looking to make Web3 more human-friendly. As a community, we have more tools available than smart contracts and purpose-specific networks. By presenting these concepts in an accessible way, we hope to encourage web3 buidlers to re-examine their assumptions of what’s possible, and continue to work for a safer, more mainstream Web3.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|15:40|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Beyond Account Abstraction - Better Experiences and Safety using Cryptography&dates=20230302T154000Z-07:00/20230302T160000Z-07:00)|

|Bug Patterns in Solidity and Smart Contract Auditing|In the past year, we (Dedaub) have disclosed numerous vulnerabilities in deployed smart contracts and received 10 significant bug bounties totaling over $3M. The talk derives from this experience: I'll talk about the Dedaub tooling (including the contract-library.com code explorer) and a couple of Solidity patterns that have been behind high-value vulnerabilities we've identified. The main body of the talk, however, will focus on a simple question: "what can I do as a developer to make my smart contract auditor more efficient and effective?" This is not much different from asking "how can I write better code?" but I intend to give actionable advice, based on numerous audits (and instances of hair pulling).

In a way, this is an update of previous talks of the past 10 months or so. E.g., talks given at the Solidity Summit:
https://summit.soliditylang.org/agenda  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcRY0oMscoM)
and at Chainlink SmartCon 2022:
https://smartcon.chain.link/agenda

The current proposal updates these talks with slightly different technical content: both because of new items, and because I'm keeping the elements that work best. (E.g., I had a talk at TrustX that turned out to be a bit "too technical". The above seem to be "just right".)|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|14:35|2023-02-28|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Bug Patterns in Solidity and Smart Contract Auditing&dates=20230228T143500Z-07:00/20230228T145500Z-07:00)|

The JSON-RPC standard is extensive and modular by design, but everyone supports the same endpoints, with little to no experimentation existing in the space. The first lesson for Web3 newcomers is: “This is your blockchain node, you will use it all the time”, but then we point them to additional APIs for indexing, NFTs, mempool, etc. Wouldn’t it be better if we could flip a switch and everyone in the space could extend this standard to their heart's content?

So, join us to see what the possibilities are if we push the boundaries in implementing new concepts in the already familiar JSON-RPC.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|17:40|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=What’s Next for Web3 Node Infrastructure?&dates=20230302T174000Z-07:00/20230302T180000Z-07:00)|

|Scaling the Internet of Value or The Power of the Partnership Playbook|Scaling the Internet of Value: The future of the Web is here, but its not evenly distributed, yet.  The next challenge for crypto and Web3 is not just building apps for crypto-native traders, gamers etc, but building widely accessible applications for the masses.  One way to help accelerate this development is by attracting more developers to the space and providing them with tools that make it easier for them to scale their applications.  Another area for improvement is creating infra tools that allow more and more users (not matter their technical sophistication) to participate in execution and validation of the network by running nodes but abstracting the difficulty away.

Power of Partnership Playbook: Additional theme from 2022 is that the right partnerships moved the ecosystem forward leaps and bounds beyond any individual contributors work.  Whether it was the Eth Foundation partnering with developers, various ETH clients and others to help pull of The Merge; Polygon partnering with Starbucks; or Google partnering with Coinbase - we've seen the power that partnerships have for bringing the next billion users to Web3.

We then realized that in addition to that, there was another problem. The African tech ecosystem is fragmented; there are 54 countries (or 55 countries depending on who you ask) and we also have the added challenge of it being a low-trust environment where people aren't sharing information and resources. We wanted to harness the community that we at Pariti had built having served over 1500 founders in the past 3 years and create a community of similarly minded founders. We've had amazing traction, having just launched in November and already having the greatest founder community ever seen in Africa. And we have 3 projects underway.

|Young Trailblazers: The Penguin Incubator Project & Other Stories|Join us for a lively session showcasing projects from young creators under 20. They are in high school or their first years in college and already coming up with awesome applications of blockchain technology.

For The Penguin Project: Discuss the way in which we are allowing users to utilize standard authentication (like google, apple, email, etc.) with Web3Auth and/or Keyp and traditional payment methods (debit, credit, stripe), to mint NFTs on the Polygon blockchain that represent a donation/sponsorship of a real world need.  We have also created a parallel "crypto focused" checkout method that utilizes Depay.  The struggle of offering both models is pretty interesting.

In our case we are minting tokens to represent Penguin Incubators that go directly to funding the creation and maintenance of incubators that support African Penguin populations through a foundation called Penguins International.  The NFTs are then used to token gate content relating to the outcomes created by the incubators as time goes on. We're utilizing a Wordpress plugin to gate the content after minting to allow our tokens to extend beyond our domain and activate a website built in a very standard web2 manner.

Discuss the struggles of web3 authentication, receiving payment, creating a smooth user experience, and ensuring reliable outcomes would be the general focus of my talk.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|15:30|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Young Trailblazers: The Penguin Incubator Project & Other Stories&dates=20230304T153000Z-07:00/20230304T155000Z-07:00)|

|Decentralized Security Data Framework for Web3|How to prevent the web3 security data from the risk of censorship 	
What types of data do we need?
Token & NFT security can protect users from rug pulls and fake projects.
Our malicious address database ensures that transactions and tokens aren’t sent to scammers.
By securing each approval and signature, we can be safer in Web3.
   The risk of the new censorship
The world of web2 security is the same as that of many other web2 companies.
Security data is siloed by each company, leading to inefficiencies and monopolies.
Data is abused in web2 security. The security data that gives enhanced decision-making power is monopolized, and companies use this security data monopoly to gain further revenue from their users.
Because of this, it is impossible to leverage positive competition and cooperation to provide users with better security services.
We need a new possibility for web3
We need to make sure security in web3 is for the user: based on a decentralized architecture and designed with an open framework. Developers can provide data to a permissionless test framework to obtain the right to provide data to the official framework. While these data are stored in a permissionless, decentralized architecture, users will be able to use data. You could also contribute and gain more on this through staking and participation.
We are looking forward to sharing more when we meet in Denver!|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|09:00|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Decentralized Security Data Framework for Web3&dates=20230302T090000Z-07:00/20230302T092000Z-07:00)|

|The Missing killer social app: Web3 social and what it takes to overtake web2 social|Since the rise of Ethereum in 2016, the blockchain community has been grasping for successful use cases beyond the financial world. Meanwhile, social media is clearly ripe for disruption via the theoretical promises that web3 delivers. A collision is inevitable – But so far, the Web3 solutions on the market have failed to deliver. We’ve seen many nearly-cloned-but-subpar experiences of existing social sites that people are already used to engaging with every day, with added inconveniences of having to pay for every user interaction and vague promises of better creator monetization or data ownership. We know that Web3 has the potential to upend the social media paradigm. But instead of cloning existing social media applications as “web3 versions of X”, creators need to introduce novel solutions with the best of what decentralized networks can enable.

|Creator Control: How Web3 Is Leveling the Playing Field for Creators|As we enter the next stage of the internet, we are at a pivotal moment for the future of social media. There is a power imbalance in the way our current social networks are dictated. In recent news, this has become apparent as Twitter undergoes significant changes to its leadership and protocols all of which leave creators that have put their blood, sweat, and tears into building a loyal following on the platform left hanging in the balance. 

For too long, creators have been subject to playing by the rules of a monopoly of social media platforms. As blockchain technology enters the world of social media, NFTs are fueling a revolution for creators to connect with their fans outside the walled gardens of traditional platforms. This doesn’t mean that platforms will completely fall by the wayside - instead, they will be forced to innovate and remain competitive so that communities will continue to use their service.

In this talk, Unlock founder Julien Genestoux will discuss how NFTs are enabling creators to have true ownership of their communities. As technology gives creators the power to bring their communities with them in and outside of platforms, he will explore how this will change the power dynamics between platforms and creators.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|09:20|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Creator Control: How Web3 Is Leveling the Playing Field for Creators&dates=20230302T092000Z-07:00/20230302T094000Z-07:00)|

|The Biology of Token Networks|The Biology of Token Networks will propose a framework for recognizing patterns across token networks — which are fluid, dynamic systems — providing all web3 builders with more insight into the token design mechanisms that can be used to create successful protocols and networks in the future.

As context, for years blockchain-oriented communities have been referred to as “ecosystems”, however, our understanding of these ecosystems is not commensurate with their complexity. There is a clear need for a more sophisticated understanding of the numerous, interdependent mechanisms used in the design of token-based networks. Token design as a discipline has been evolving for several years now, and the open, living resource presented during this talk will advance the discipline — helping it to mature beyond the first phase of experimentation, and evolve into a discipline with best practices, and eventually industry standards which are used for designing and engineering token networks. By creating a shared language and taxonomy of design mechanisms being used by entrepreneurs, developers, and designers, will be able to more effectively design for the outcomes they aim to achieve. 

Over the past 4 years particularly, there have been massive efforts to increase the shared understanding of token design and blockchain networks. The fruit of those efforts are often captured within incredibly thoughtful papers, blog posts, academic research, videos, and more. These long-form analyses often address the discuss mechanisms and actors in network in a very abstract, academic sense. Additionally, there has been massive progress in the field of blockchain analytics, with successful platforms such as Nansen, Dune Analytics, Chainalysis, and more. However, analytics products provide unopinionated data in bulk, which is generally not tied to the design decisions made in the development of the networks in question. 

As a result, the blockchain space overall has large amounts of structured on-chain data, and deep, nuanced theoretical works. However, when it comes to the task of designing crypto-native networks, there remains a huge gap between the theoretical and the empirical. The subject matter of this talk will aim to close that gap by defining a methodology for analyzing the specific mechanisms best suited to driving particular outcomes for token networks. Much of the information currently available to founders, engineers, and designers doesn’t provide data-driven insights into the mechanisms that have been used in the past across multiple protocols, why they were used, and what the outcomes were as a result. 

In this talk, I’ll propose a framework for capturing and analyzing this data across numerous token networks, establishing the venue for discourse about how organic, ever-changing token networks can be measured as it relates to token design. I expect this to be a foundational starting point, which allows web3 builders across the globe to build upon and refine over time. During the talk I’ll discuss the process of how I arrived at the proposed framework, and propose my view of how it could continue to evolve over time, along with ways in which individuals and organizations can contribute to its development as well. 

The initial framework and data set will consist of a database containing successful web3 protocols/networks, along with:
- Case studies of each respective token design (Several case studies provided initially as examples)
- Primary actors within each token network
- Type of Project and the associated goals of the protocol / network
- Mechanisms employed (Buy & Burn, Pass-through Yield, Voting Escrow, etc.)
- Outcome of each token design, which may include qualitative factors or key metrics such as number of voters on proposals, token price, etc.
- Scatter plot that exhibits the correlation between mechanisms used by particular networks and the metrics used to measure the success of those networks

This will be achieved through the open-source data and framework which the broader web3 community can contribute to and continually improve upon over time.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|11:40|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Biology of Token Networks&dates=20230303T114000Z-07:00/20230303T120000Z-07:00)|
|Zero Knowledge Virtual Machines: Running Rust code inside a Zero Knowledge Proof.|Zero Knowledge Proofs have a lot of promise for both increasing privacy and scaling by verifying the correctness of off-chain computation.  However, the development of traditional circuit based ZKPs is challenging, since the programmer needs to learn new languages, new concepts, and new development tooling.  A new class of Zero Knowledge Virtual Machines is attempting to allow ordinary code, such as Solidity or Rust to run inside ZKPs.  This talk will describe how such ZKVMs work, including a basic background on ZKPs, arithmetic circuits, permutation arguments, and representations of memory, as well as providing resources for getting started using ZKVMs to implement off chain logic.|Decentralized Finance Stage|13:30|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Zero Knowledge Virtual Machines: Running Rust code inside a Zero Knowledge Proof.&dates=20230304T133000Z-07:00/20230304T135000Z-07:00)|
|Security: The Make or Break For Transitioning from Web2 to Web3|Every application in Web3 is a financial application, unlike in Web2 where only a small amount of applications are actually financial (e.g. fintech). There are a lot of security risks that in Web3 that didn’t exist in Web2. As a result, developers building in Web2 may not be as aware or focused on the security aspect — it is usually an afterthought that doesn’t get much attention.
And because every Web3 application is a financial application, there are strong incentives for bad actors (internal and external) to test your security. We need to look no further than the persistent hacks to DeFi projects, which have scaled at unprecedented rates with insufficient security in place. Developers on your team have the ability to write and deploy code, debug, look at the database, etc. You’re essentially giving your developers the ability to steal millions of dollars. 
The open-source nature of Web3 building also needs to be considered. While open source makes Web3 very powerful, it also means that code and data are open sourced, which requires a different way of building. 
Smart contract development and deployment processes also differ significantly as one cannot make changes whenever you want. If the smart contract is immutable, it is a much more complex process and building security into the code take a new approach.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|15:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Security: The Make or Break For Transitioning from Web2 to Web3&dates=20230303T152000Z-07:00/20230303T154000Z-07:00)|

|Disrupting the Music Industry and Building a Web3 Interactive Music Platform|A Game Changer has shifted the music industry and it has been heavily disrupted by technology, leading to a decline in traditional revenue streams such as music studios, record labels and a shift towards streaming services. However, the centralized nature of these platforms has resulted in a lack of transparency, control for music artists and a lack of connection to their community.
Muverse, a web3 interactive music platform offers a solution by utilizing decentralized technology to create a more equitable and transparent ecosystem. This platform would allow artists to directly connect with their fans, monetize their content, and retain ownership of their intellectual property.
The platform would also utilize blockchain technology to securely track and manage rights and royalties, ensuring that artists receive fair compensation for their work. With a Web3 Interactive Music Platform, artists have the ability to engage with their audience in new and innovative ways, creating a more immersive, interactive and personalized music experience. 
Music fans, collectors and content creators can enhance the connection between music fans and artists by providing a more community driven, content creating and experiential experience.   .
By building a Web3 Interactive Music Platform, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for the music artists, icons, fans and collectors.

|VC Investing Our Way Out of Winter|Many view the bear market as the best time to build, but the builders still need capital. In wake of the many debacles and the depressed crypto prices, investors have been more cautious about specific business models, wary of valuations, and putting more pressure on founders. But there remains fundamental (and difficult) questions that investors still ask — 

1. What VCs are looking for as signs of “legitimacy”? (aka how to prove your project isn’t a slow rug?) 
2. Which types of projects are still shipping? And who will weather the winter the best?
3. How do you decide whether to continue, to raise at a downround, or to close shop and return capital to investors?

|Bootstrap your Ethereum dapp with one simple command|This workshop is going to help hackers quickly get through the boilerplate phase. We will walk through a simple tool which will help to bootstrap an Ethereum dapp for a hackathon project. It is focused to be simple, modular, and pragmatic to the goal of giving hackers what they need to buidl. It will support some of the most popular and latest tooling such as foundry, svelte, web3modal, and tailwind.

Right now there is a lot of great tooling out there but is not supported on the apps I found on GitHub. At Taiko we use svelte for our bridge, so I know the documentation here can be lacking. I want to help make it easy for beginners or intermediates to get started quick on their dapp for the hackathon and allow them to use the tools they are most comfortable with.

It will support some sane defaults and also the most common setups / configurations that hackers would use. Additionally, it will come with the configurations for how to deploy your dapp to various networks on Layer 2, not just on Layer 1.

It will also come with documentation on how the bootstrapped project is setup so that they can learn and understand.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|16:30|2023-02-24|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Bootstrap your Ethereum dapp with one simple command&dates=20230224T163000Z-07:00/20230224T170000Z-07:00)|

|Web3 identity off-chain, on-chain, and both|We used to live in a world where the only input to an individual's reputation and identity was their word. After all, “A man is only as good as his word.” 

Now we face the opposite problem, there are too many inputs from too many unverified sources. It’s less about your word but whatever words an algorithm places on top of a search field.

At its core, Web3 can take promises made with words and verify them with actions, a sort of put your wallet address where your mouth is. But how should this information be visualized? How do we unify a user's identity, protect their privacy, and verify sources contributing to this identity? How do we take work out of silos and collaborate? What does reputation look like in this new ecosystem?

Disco is creating data backpacks for off-chain credentials, Optimism has started widely adopted on-chain NFT quests, impact cards are measuring impact on and off chain, and the list goes on. As more projects try to represent the multifaceted actions and build the Web3 persona, let’s ask some tough questions around what this should look like, existing projects philosophies on web3 identity, and more importantly where this information should live on-chain, off-chain, and both?

EthDenver attendees are the stewards of identity and reputation now and what it will look like in the future. The ideas shared in this panel will spread into the work that builders are doing and become a point of consideration for users. How will this project contribute to building the Web3 persona,  how do you want to be represented in Web3, and do you agree with this approach? An individual chooses their words and their actions, but it's up to us to find a way for them to accurately relay this to the broader Web3 ecosystem.

|New PR Rules for Web3|Web3 and crypto leaders face two major public relations challenges in their role. 

First, the decentralized nature of web3 protocols means there’s a global community and governance layer to communicate with.

Second, crypto founders are often required to educate the public about blockchain technology while simultaneously battling its stigma. That’s a tough ask for anybody, so I think the traditional PR and marketing rule book has to be relooked at and tailored for web3. 

Here is a guide from lessons learnt from experience helping founders tell their stories across the bull and bear markets of crypto. 

 In my talk I will cover the following:

* The difference between marketing, PR and community building
* The importance of crypto Twitter
* The Web3 media landscape and its gatekeepers - journalists

|One Weird Trick to Good Tokenomics|"Tokenomics" often presents an operational headache to developers, who must answer a laundry list of complex questions around allocation, airdrops, Treasury management, emissions, governance, inflation, and so on. Even worse, tokenomics can serve as a financial distraction to developers, who spend cycles on engineering price pops than on engineering the protocol. This talk aims to provide a single and unifying "north star" to developers, i.e. a single and simple principle that they can use to answer each question in a consistent and farsighted manner. That principle is: "incentivize civic behavior sustainably" or more simply "solve externalities." The talk offers a four-step recipe for protocol developers to operationalize this principle: identify positive and negative externalities, identify the key actors, set up the redistribution mechanism, and calibrate the mechanism's sustainability. I work through examples like governance and airdrops, and I briefly illustrate how some major protocols have embodied this principle. With this, protocol designers can reduce the operational complexity and financial noise around tokenomics, and build for long-term success.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|13:00|2023-02-27|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=One Weird Trick to Good Tokenomics&dates=20230227T130000Z-07:00/20230227T132000Z-07:00)|

|DeFi meets real world impact: how blockchain is expanding financial access in emerging markets|In this talk, I will showcase how blockchain technology is transforming financial access in emerging markets – a foil to the narrative that crypto has yet to find its killer real-world application.
 
I will share with the ETHDenver community how blockchain enables a new approach to providing affordable financing to microenterprises and small businesses, from medical clinics in Kenya to local bakeries in the Philippines.

First, I will provide a high-level overview of the fascinating history of microfinance and previous approaches to expand financial access in emerging markets  – from what worked in traditional community finance (“Microfinance 1.0” - where borrowers share ownership) to fintech lending (“Microfinance 2.0” - which enabled scale, but lost the community ownership element), and how the blockchain has enabled a new wave of financial inclusion initiatives (“Microfinance 3.0” - which unlocks a new wave of affordable financing for emerging markets and puts borrowers on a path to building wealth & prosperity by allowing the traditional means of community ownership to scale globally). The presentation will be peppered with fun personal anecdotes from my time working on initiatives across each of these phases. We’ll all learn, laugh and get inspired to build for impact!

In addition to this presentation, I’ve been speaking with several of our investors (BlockTower Capital, Flori Ventures/Tomer Bariach, TCG Crypto, Packy McCormick, Anand Iyer) about putting together a panel on Real World Assets (RWA) moving on chain, and DeFi 2.0: real-world credit applications.

As a Web3 builder based in Nairobi, I’d love to share more about other innovative use cases of blockchain technology I have seen in Kenya on the “Blockchain meets Impact” theme – from ecology preservation to improving government accountability and service delivery to unlocking economic growth by bringing land rights on chain.

I gave a similar presentation and spoke on several panels at ETH Safari, Africa’s first ETH conference – sort of like ETH Denver but much smaller and on the Kenyan coast. I haven’t been able to track down video footage, but you can read more about the panels I spoke on at https://ethsafari.xyz/agenda:

|Zero Knowledge cryptography will enable the future of publicly verifiable elections|Election integrity and misinformation surrounding the validity of elections remain a threat to democratic nations around the world. In tandem, blockchain technology provides the key attributes of transparency and anonymity needed to resolve this dilemma, leaving spectators wondering “how will blockchain aid the global struggle for democracy?” 

While technology may not be able to solve all these problems, ever or all at once. Election verification is a great place to start. Zero-knowledge cryptography in particular is emerging as a viable solution to resolve election uncertainty and protect the credibility of democracy.  Because zero knowledge allows people and information to be verified as authentic without revealing personal information. In other words, it’s perfect for publicly verifying unique, authentic votes while keeping individual voters’ identities private. In this talk, Howard Wu founder of Aleo will discuss how zero-knowledge can be implemented into election systems to provide voters and governments with transparency and privacy in election cycles.|Bunny Slopes|13:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Zero Knowledge cryptography will enable the future of publicly verifiable elections&dates=20230304T130000Z-07:00/20230304T132000Z-07:00)|

Concurrently, despite a grueling bear market the industry has witnessed the rise of a mainstream media establishment increasingly willing and capable of covering on-chain events such as stablecoin burns, centralized exchange reserves, and connections between blockchain addresses. In tandem, these trends point to an irreversible rise in onchain literacy that may have significant implications for privacy preservation on public blockchains.

- How top-of-mind is the multichain strategy for tools at the moment? Is this expected to change over the course of this year?
- What is easy / complicated about making devtools work on other chains? 
- How can L1s & L2s help reduce the complexity of porting devtools to different environments? What are good / less good examples of that?
- With more protocols focusing on interoperability between different layers from the get go, do devtools need to think differently around what chains/ecosystems/functions they cover? E.g., do cross chain protocols have different needs regarding dev tools and is this market important or large enough to build for?
- Depending on who exactly we recruit for the panel, we might go into different details on certain aspects.

|Say what? How content design can make or break the future of web3|Right now we’re at a crossroads. Many people see our ecosystem as confusing, scam-ridden, and a really good way to lose lots of money. A big part of this is because the language we use in just about every platform out there can be confusingly opaque. Take a moment to think about how a newbie to crypto might feel when they see words like gas fee, nonce, seed phrase. There’s something inherently scary about the unknown, especially when what you don’t know has the potential to cost you so much. It’s no surprise that so many folks are still reluctant to embrace what we’ve been working so hard to build! Even people who’ve been active in crypto for years regularly get rekt thanks to unclear language and murky UX.

Now’s our chance to reimagine how we might make web3 feel safer, simpler, and more accessible for anyone who wants to get in the mix — as well as for everyone already active in the space. To make this work, we need to work together, and collectively focus on how we can improve web3 through UX, specifically content design and language. 

In this talk, I'll share some real life user problems and how we can solve them, a few tips, tricks and tools for teams new to content design, and a fresh perspective on why language is one of our most powerful (and empowering!) secret weapons for the future of web3.|DAOS + Community Stage|17:10|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Say what?

|How to stop your wallet from collecting your personal data: Enabling the Nym Mixnet with Metamask|Recently, there has been various privacy scandals about how wallets, such as Metamask, and the very RPC nodes used to access Ethereum, such as Infura, are collecting personal data such as IP addresses. This personal data can be used to de-anonymize Ethereum addresses and link transactions to real-world identities. In this presentation, we show how to use the Nym mixnet today to block even Infura from gathering the IP address, as well as the exact time and nature, of your transaction. We show how to enable the Nym mixnet inside of Metamask and how it compares to other less privacy-preserving options such as VPNs, Tor, and HOPR, none of which can defend against a powerful adversary with a 'God's eye' view of the entire Ethereum network. As a bonus, we will show how Ethereum 2.0 validators can deploy the Nym mixnet to make sure they do not suffer from a DDoS attack in the new Ethereum consensus algorithm.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|13:50|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How to stop your wallet from collecting your personal data: Enabling the Nym Mixnet with Metamask&dates=20230302T135000Z-07:00/20230302T141000Z-07:00)|
|Wallet UX teardown: how wallets need to change if the goal is mass adoption|What if I told you every account you created on every website you’ve visited in your life might have some money just sitting in it? In Web3, “create a wallet” is the new “create an account.” I’ve done a deep dive into wallets and found design trends that are going to confuse non-Web3-fluent people so much that many will simply abandon them, often before using them even once. And these go far beyond the “store your passphrase on a piece of metal in a fireproof box.” Want to make your wallet work better for new (and current) users? I’ll show you the biggest and most common wallet UX problems and suggest basic changes you can start implementing tomorrow.|Decentralized Finance Stage|10:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Wallet UX teardown: how wallets need to change if the goal is mass adoption&dates=20230304T102000Z-07:00/20230304T104000Z-07:00)|

|Supercharging the UX of Web3 Wallets|This presentation is focused on the user experience of self-custodial wallets: what the current pain points are, where the opportunities lie, and exciting innovations in the space. The current mainstream self-custodial wallet user experience requires a steep learning curve. Big questions include how can we make the UX easy for beginners to on-ramp and start interacting with dapps? Some of the largest pain points today are around storing recovery phrases, transacting safely, and being able to easily on/off ramp to fiat. As the world of crypto evolves and new chains emerge, wallets also need to become more interoperable across chains. From a developer perspective, we would also love to touch on the future of wallets as a building tool for new ecosystems: MPC technology, testnet faucets, and easy custom network management are key to making integrating wallets intuitive for devs.|Bunny Slopes|14:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Supercharging the UX of Web3 Wallets&dates=20230304T144000Z-07:00/20230304T150000Z-07:00)|

|The Next Wave of DeFi will be Use Case Driven|DeFi adoption has been slow due to poor user experience and lack of obvious use cases. Everyday users do not care about the underlying technology of DeFi - they can about what that technology enables. Kuberan Marimuthu, Chase Ando, and Zack Scholnik will discuss how the next wave of DeFi will focus on use cases versus the underlying technology. They will explore how everyday people need (1) compelling use cases enabled by DeFi and (2) an extremely easy way to onboard to Web3 applications. The speakers will present how gamification and seamless money movement can make DeFi fun and easy for new users, ultimately leading to wider adoption and success in the market.

Kuberan Marimuthu is the CEO & Founder of Cypher Wallet - a noncustodial multichain wallet bringing web3 to the next billion users by offering a one-stop wallet users can purchase, bridge, and stake assets.

|Data Sovereignty and Decentralized Data Science in Web3|Data is a key driver of modern economy and AI/machine learning, however, a lot of this data is sensitive and handling the sensitive data has caused unprecedented challenges for both individuals and businesses. These challenges will only get more severe as we move forward in the digital era. In this talk, Prof. Dawn Song will talk about how Web3 technologies including decentralized identities, policy-compliant decentralized computation, and data sovereignty can help provide a paradigm shift to enable users and data owners to maintain better control of their data and get better benefits from their data, and break down data silos and enable data commons for public good through decentralized data science. By combining technologies including secure computing, differential privacy, federated learning, as well as blockchain technologies for data rights, we can build a platform for a responsible data economy, to enable more responsible use of data that maximizes social welfare & economic efficiency while protecting users’ data rights and enable fair distribution of value created from data.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|12:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Data Sovereignty and Decentralized Data Science in Web3&dates=20230304T120000Z-07:00/20230304T122000Z-07:00)|
|What Medium is Our Message?: Best Practices for Decentralized Social Networking|My talk would make the case for a framework of best practices to follow when building decentralized social networks. In particular, I would emphasize the necessity of using Open Source and Open Standards in this space.

I would first briefly explore social networking and identity from a sociological perspective. I’d discuss a subset of some of the important scholars/works in the space (primarily with an eye towards Marshall McLuhan’s work on media theory) and, using insights from these works, present a definition of “Web3” that build’s on Jay Graber’s definition but is inextricably linked to public goods. And, from this definition, non-exhaustively identify key principles and requirements to consider when building in this space.

An example of how this could be explored would be to justify the principle of “self-certification” as being core to the Web3 ethos. Then, we identify requirements of “self-certification” from multiple perspectives. Not just the technical requirement of user-controlled cryptography, but “softer”, mission-focused requirements as well.

I would also explore specific protocols and technologies (from DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, to DIDComm and mirror.xyz, AT Protocol and many more) and show how they fit within a principled framework of Web3.

I would conclude with a call-to-action for voluntary cooperation (and the specific steps to take to achieve this) between the major players in this space within the Ethereum ecosystem to support the composability that is foundational to the Open Web.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|12:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=What Medium is Our Message?: Best Practices for Decentralized Social Networking&dates=20230303T122000Z-07:00/20230303T124000Z-07:00)|

|Better Smart Contracts with Behavior-Driven Development|Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a method which puts user needs and team conversations at the heart of the software dev process. While BDD helps web2 teams write more valuable, secure code, it has not become popular for smart contract development yet. We aim to change that by sharing our experience successfully using BDD to write more secure DeFi smart contracts.

In this talk, Pete Laird (or Bufficorn Ventures and my teammate on ETH Denver 2022 finalist team LOUDVERSE) and I will walk participants through writing more secure and usable Solidity smart contracts using BDD. We first explain the what and why of BDD, then we describe how BDD works, and finally we code an ERC4626 vault using BDD together.

|Web2 Is Coming (Why web3 needs web2)|User experience matters for adoption and the massive unlock of the general population. 

The general public doesn't want decentralization, they don't know what it is and privacy is the least important factor in their decision to adopt right now. 

In order to ferry users into web3 we must do it without their user experience being affected in anyway. It must be abstracted and customer delight is critical vs. their satisfaction. 

Why is web3 just not able to move faster in this area? What is holding us back from executing this?

|DORA: Scalable Distributed Oracles|Connecting existing Web 2.0 data sources to blockchains is crucial for decentralized finance and beyond. An oracle network consisting of a network of independent nodes aims to address this issue by allowing blockchain smart contracts to function over inputs obtained from existing Web 2.0 data, real-world sensors, and computation interfaces. Performing this information exchange securely, however, is not trivial: most of the data sources today do not offer data in a signed form, the oracle network  also becomes vulnerable due to the compromise of a subset of oracle network nodes;  moreover, the adversary may go after the availability of the system (and at times safety) by malevolently slowing down the protocols. We address these issues, and propose a robust and scalable distributed solution for solving the oracle problem. While our approach (DORA) can withstand extreme adversarial settings, we make some real-world synchrony and input-data distribution observations, and introduce oracle execution sharding. In particular, having access to an ordering primitive such as state-machine replication (SMR), we can solve the decentralized oracle arrangement problem with only 51% honest nodes.  This makes our solution scale quite well as the number of oracle services and the size of the oracle network grow.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|10:50|2023-02-27|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=DORA: Scalable Distributed Oracles&dates=20230227T105000Z-07:00/20230227T111000Z-07:00)|

|Exploring the Use of Perpetual Protocols in DeFi Applications|This proposal is about exploring the use of perpetual protocols in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their potential to enable new forms of financial instruments and marketplaces. The focus is on how these protocols can facilitate continuous liquidity for DeFi assets, and the potential benefits and challenges of this approach.

Perpetual protocols are blockchain-based protocols that enable the creation of perpetual contracts, which are financial instruments that do not have an expiration date. These contracts are similar to traditional futures contracts, but unlike futures, they do not have an expiration date and can be held indefinitely. Perpetual protocols are used in decentralized finance (DeFi) to enable continuous liquidity for assets, such as cryptocurrencies, by allowing users to trade these assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX) without the need for a central counterparty.

There are several potential benefits to using perpetual protocols in DeFi applications. For example, they can enable the creation of new financial instruments and marketplaces that are not possible with traditional financial infrastructure. They can also facilitate the creation of more efficient and transparent financial systems by eliminating the need for central intermediaries and enabling peer-to-peer transactions.

However, there are also challenges and risks associated with the use of perpetual protocols in DeFi. These protocols are complex and may be prone to technical issues or vulnerabilities, which could have negative impacts on the stability and security of DeFi systems. Additionally, there may be regulatory and compliance challenges associated with the use of these protocols, as they operate in a decentralized and largely unregulated environment.

Overall, the proposal is about exploring the potential of perpetual protocols in DeFi and the benefits and challenges of this approach. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how these protocols can be used to enable new forms of financial instruments and marketplaces, and how they can facilitate continuous liquidity for DeFi assets.|Decentralized Finance Stage|15:50|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Exploring the Use of Perpetual Protocols in DeFi Applications&dates=20230304T155000Z-07:00/20230304T161500Z-07:00)|
|Verifiable Credentials meet Web3 thanks to ZK|Web3 will not reach mass adoption without an identity layer. Use cases such as digital democracy, personal DeFi, and portable reputation require a mechanism for identities that are richer than Ethereum addresses. To address this need, there are three main approaches: Verifiable Credentials, NFTs (SBT), and naming services (i.e ENS). While NFTs and ENS are easier to adopt and understand by the Web3 community, they do not offer the privacy and interoperability of the Verifiable Credentials approach - a standard defined by W3C and adopted by governments and organizations worldwide.
Adopting Verifiable Credentials and DID as the identity layer for Web3 has the potential to bridge the gap between Web2 and enterprise applications and bring mass adoption to Ethereum. The challenge, however, is to provide tools that streamline the adoption and implementation of these standards by the Web3 community. These tools should abstract the complexity and provide the necessary privacy and security features required to use these identities on-chain. This is where PolygonID comes in.
In this presentation, we will introduce the Polygon ID toolset provided to the Web3 community and go through some of the innovations that allow for the use of off-chain credentials in on-chain transactions.
We will also analyze the use cases and possibilities created for existing Web3 applications, such as DAOs, DeFi, and games.|Main Stage|09:45|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Verifiable Credentials meet Web3 thanks to ZK&dates=20230304T094500Z-07:00/20230304T100000Z-07:00)|

DAOs allow people around the world to join and collaborate in communities with transparent and enforceable rules.

But what happens once your DAO reaches a level where it needs legal protection to realize its potential? What happens when a DAO member goes rogue? What are the ethical obligations of the DAO founders to their members? 

This panel will discuss the benefits - and some special considerations - of legal status for DAOs, and why incorporation should be a major consideration for DAOs in 2023. We are planning to bring DAO leads from high profile projects to offer insight into their pathways to legal recognition.

EthDenver attendees are focusing on building the future technology. However, new technology and financial systems will not work without a way for society to successfully collaborate and peacefully exist. DAOs are not incredibly different from the traditional world. Rather, they are an improvement of our current governance systems. 

If this past year has taught the crypto community anything, it is that no matter how regulated and trustworthy something appears, centralized entities can be co-opted, and human greed can be obfuscated. Hopefully, the wakeup calls of 2022 – from Celsius Network to FTX – show the need to decentralize assets and decision-making and will lead to a renaissance in DAOs. With accelerating investment in DAO tooling, DAOs will become leaner and more efficient and be as frictionless to participate in during a normal day as checking your Telegram messages. One way to get to this next level is to make the necessary handshake with the existing legal system in order to enable DAOs to mature and integrate with the rest of the global economy. Doing so does not require a compromise in decentralization and can serve as a means by which 2023 will become the year of the DAO.|DAOS + Community Stage|12:55|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Incorporating Your DAO: The Pros, the Cons, and the Weird Sh*t No One Tells You About&dates=20230303T125500Z-07:00/20230303T132000Z-07:00)|

|Ending extreme poverty with a stablecoin|tl;dr:

- 650 million people live in extreme poverty. Basic income programs can fix this, but require money
- Money now comes from donations, but there’s not enough donations in the world
- Introducing Glo - a new stablecoin that helps end extreme poverty by redirecting 100% of revenue to basic income programs

Extreme poverty is the worst kind of poverty and is defined at living with under $2.15/day. 650 million people currently live in extreme poverty. The good news is there is a relatively simple solution: giving them basic incomes. This has been done on small scales, and generally works well. The bad news is that to give everyone in extreme poverty a basic income, we’d need ~$311 billion/year. 

Currently, these basic incomes are funded by charitable donations. But that’s not going to cut it: total overseas giving, both private and public, from all countries combined, is $243 billion/year. So even if 100% of that were directed to basic incomes (highly unlikely) it’s not enough.

Can we find other sources of money to lift people out of extreme poverty? Can we fund basic incomes without depending on donations?

Introducing Glo (USDGLO) - the stablecoin that reduces extreme poverty. Exactly like other stablecoins we invest our assets under management in US Government Bonds: T-Bills, but unlike other stablecoins we redirect 100% of the proceeds of those T-Bills to basic income programs for people in extreme poverty.

Currently stablecoin issuers make 4.2% interest on their assets. With a $60 billion+ market cap Tether is currently making $2 billion a year in interest. That’s enough to lift over 4 million people out of extreme poverty. All you need to do is switch to a different stablecoin.

Oh, and more thing: transfers in USDGLO dollar are 10% cheaper than the competition due to a smart contract optimisation.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|09:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Ending extreme poverty with a stablecoin&dates=20230304T092000Z-07:00/20230304T094000Z-07:00)|
|Future of Threat Prevention - We can detect exploits, but how do we stop them?|Forta is a real-time threat detection network, and it's getting better at detecting bad actors and exploits on chain BEFORE a loss event occurs using data science and machine learning techniques. But early detection is only half the battle. To actually prevent a loss, a DeFi protocol needs to respond quickly to a Forta alert (often w/in a few blocks). The challenge today is protocols don't have automated emergency response mechanisms - pause buttons are manually triggered by a multisig, and average time to pause a protocol over the last 4 years has been 24+ hours. Too slow to prevent an attack, even if a protocol team knows about it in advance. 

There are a variety of approaches to "prevention" in Web 3 including more advanced automated circuit breakers, new custody models inspired by the hot-cold wallet distribution at centralized exchanges, screening for/blocking high risk transactions at the base layer, and embedding transaction reversibility features at the asset layer. 

In this presentation, I'll quickly but effectively present the different approaches to exploit prevention (focused primarily on DeFi protocols and bridges), and discuss their unique pros and cons.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|10:40|2023-02-28|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Future of Threat Prevention - We can detect exploits, but how do we stop them?&dates=20230228T104000Z-07:00/20230228T110000Z-07:00)|
|Decentralized, Not Fragmented: Using Community Agreements to Connect Interoperable dApps|We believe community agreements are the future of the web.

Decentralized should not mean fragmented and we think these portable community agreements can play a crucial role in helping make sure our tools work together to best serve communities. In this way, we can create a multiplayer internet that derives authority from each community's smart contract rather than a centralized intermediary.

We'll discuss how community agreements can help developers connect their applications and allow for united interoperable suites of tools that together provide a superior experience and value proposition for communities.

|Distributed Infrastructure for a Distributed Network: Gnosis and Gateway.fm|When accessing blockchains today, we often rely on centralised services. These services grow big and gain international success. Consequently, lots of nodes are grouped in just a few locations around the globe.

Risks and concerns of that are quite well understood, from privacy to legal and censorship.
For a blockchain to be really decentralised, all critical pieces of infrastructure, like RPC services, validators, block explorers are distributed across the globe. But building an infrastructure system that is actually distributed brings its own sets of challenges.

In my talk, I will share our experiences in building infrastructure that works across platforms, from bare metal Linux to AWS cloud. I will discuss the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the successes we achieved while building this infrastructure. I will also delve into the importance of distributing nodes around the world, the criteria we use to measure our success, and what comes next.

|Building 3D Communities|TLDR: A discussion on the future of internet communities

Internet communities over the past two decades have been competely dominated by megaclusters like facebook, instagram, and twitter. These megaclusters have been helpful in connecting the world, but their very nature sacrifices depth and nuance. 

Communities organized within these clusters were necessarily two dimensional. They had to work within the confines of an extremely generic system. 

It is time we migrate to a new model that favors smaller independent nodes, each with a custom array of tooling and customs. With the proper leeway to cater to their specific cultures and practices, these community nodes can finally become three dimensional. 3D communities are defined by their ability to provide a holistic experience to their members. They’ve moved beyond being simple chat rooms. They are becoming like cities: built to serve multiple needs of their members. Make a friend, learn something new, get a job, find a collaborator, be entertained, invest your money.

What will be possible in this new future? What’s causing it? How can we anticipate the new opportunities and challenges that will arise from it?

However, modern “dApps” have big problems related to data. Not everything can be built on the blockchain: it's expensive and slow. And since there’s nowhere to put personal state that shouldn’t live on a blockchain, they either store data locally which leads to poor UX or worse on a central server.

|What Ethereum can learn from Cosmos|As Ethereum moves closer to a Wasm-native runtime, it is good to learn from other technically strong Wasm projects.
CosmWasm is a Cosmos-native smart contract engine based on Wasm, designed from the ground up with
a security-first mentality. We learned much from Ethereum’s successes and failures and would like to share
our experiences as well.

Cosmos is a network of over 50 PoS Blockchains connected via trust-minimized IBC bridges. It has been a pioneer in
BFT consensus algorithms, secure bridging technology, and the multi-chain / app-chain thesis since 2016.

CosmWasm started in 2019 and is now the best smart contract platform made for Cosmos… but it’s not just for Cosmos.
It is the reason many projects have migrated to Cosmos - Engima (now Secret) and dYdX from Ethereum;
Burnt Finance and Katana from Solana; Datachain from Hyperledger and more. It powered Terra’s DeFi ecosystem.
And Composable Finance is even running CosmWasm contracts on a Polkadot parachain.

CosmWasm is also the first multi-chain native smart contract engine, allowing contracts to directly interact with other
chains by defining custom IBC protocols. For example, a DAO on Juno can vote to issue an NFT on Stargaze, and place
protocol-owned liquidity to it’s pools on Osmosis. It is also being used to build out Mesh Security, a decentralized,
multi-chain future for PoS chains to share security bidirectionally.

We would love to introduce the Ethereum community to CosmWasm and invite them to learn more; whether it is
getting inspiration for eWasm, or potentially integrating CosmWasm alongside the EVM in a layer 2 rollup.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|17:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=What Ethereum can learn from Cosmos&dates=20230304T170000Z-07:00/20230304T172000Z-07:00)|

|Why Some Staking Providers Will Fail After Shanghai Update|Over the past 2 years, we have seen a strong trend of blockchain networks switching from DPoS to PoS for consensus which will continue after the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. Many in the blockchain industry have welcomed this shift with enthusiasm because PoS is significantly more decentralized than DPoS and allows more individuals and entities to participate in the staking process. 
In this talk, I will consider the several critical technical challenges that the industry will face as it shifts from DPoS to PoS. For example, for staking providers, significantly more nodes might be required.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|10:00|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Why Some Staking Providers Will Fail After Shanghai Update&dates=20230302T100000Z-07:00/20230302T102000Z-07:00)|
|Upgrading Your DAO's Operating System: A Hands On Experience|I will walk participants through what we call the "continuous participatory change" loop. By doing so, they will gain a new framework and lens through which to see their DAOs. Using the metaphor of an operating system and a tool called the Operating System Canvas, participants will learn that there are actually many, many, many deliberate decisions about how their organization works available to them at any time. By carefully considering the types of principles and practices that allow them to become more People Positive and Complexity Conscious, they can build self-managing organizations that get stronger over time. This workshop will help them work with the very real organizational tensions that currently exist within their DAO, consider practices that may address those tensions, and then design a real-world experiment that will get them on the path of continuous evolution.|#BUIDL Palace|15:30|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Upgrading Your DAO's Operating System: A Hands On Experience&dates=20230303T153000Z-07:00/20230303T160000Z-07:00)|
|Decentralized Autonomous Hyperspas: A vision for a more fluid and frictionless future|Decentralized Autonomous Hyperspas (DAHs) offer a new paradigm for spa management, enabling a more fluid and frictionless flow of people, resources, and value. By decentralizing control and decision-making to sufficiently kawaii artificial intelligence, and using blockchain technology to facilitate automatic, transparent execution of spa rules and agreements, DAHs can create more flexible, pliable, and adaptive worlds through ritualized hyperspa experiences. In this talk, we will explore the potential of DAHs to revolutionize the spa industry by addressing the insuppressible frictions that arise within traditional spa models, such as issues of accessibility, affordability, and sustainability. We will also consider how DAHs can create new opportunities for relaxation, rejuvenation, and community building, drawing on ideas from Putnam social theory, Glaeserian cities, Lacanian film analysis, new age wellness, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

|Change is (Finally) Coming! - Understanding the New Rules of NFT Sales and Secured Finanicng|The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a comprehensive set of laws governing all commercial transactions in the United States, including the sale of goods and lending transactions that involve the granting of credit secured by personal property. The bulk of these laws were written and enacted in the 1950s and 1990s. And Ethereum was nothing but a twinkle in Vitalik's eye the last time the UCC saw any meaningful amendment. So the UCC, like many US laws, is outdated and ill equipped to handle the unique asset class that is virtual currency, digital tokens, or NFTs. 

However, this may soon change. On July 13, 2022, the Uniform Law Commission and American Law Institute jointly approved amendments to the UCC, creating a new Article 12 designed to govern the transfer of property rights in digital assets (or what the UCC will call controllable electronic records (CERs)). If states begin to pass their own versions of Article 12 in the near future, then we will see a significant shift in the legal rules of Defi, NFTs, and any digital asset falling into the new CER category. Most notably, the new amendments will (i) add a technology-neutral functional equivalent of “possession” focusing on control of an digital asset, (ii) create safe-harbor rules for down-stream good faith purchasers of stolen digital assets, and (iii) clarify a lender's best route to create or perfect a security interest in digital assets. 

All of these changes will need to be noted and incorporated into the way we think about our contracts (both smart or written). 

My proposed talk will be a breakdown of the existing laws and where they fall short. Followed by an introduction of the new laws and how they should be interpreted. I will end with meaningful ways we can be prepared for the coming changes.|NFTs + Metaverse, + Gaming Stage|09:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Change is (Finally) Coming! - Understanding the New Rules of NFT Sales and Secured Finanicng&dates=20230304T094000Z-07:00/20230304T100000Z-07:00)|

|Security in web3: a series of unfortunate events|Dear Reader,

I'm sorry to say that the presentation you are about to view is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about several hacks that occurred across DeFi and CeFi platforms. Even though web3 offers the potential for increased financial inclusion and decentralization, it has also been plagued by malicious actors who have exploited vulnerabilities to steal funds.
From the very beginning of this presentation, when we discuss the first hack to make headlines, continuing on through the entire discussion, the spectre of danger lurks. One might say that blockchain platforms are magnets for misfortune.
In this short presentation, we will cover greedy and repulsive founders, vulnerable smart contracts, security breaches, and plots to steal users' funds.
It is my sad duty to delve into these unpleasant tales to seek solutions and redemption where it can be found. But there is nothing stopping you from leaving the presentation and focusing on something more uplifting if you prefer that sort of thing.

With all due respect,
Bianca Buzea

This presentation will cover the history of hacks and thefts in the blockchain space.  We will ascertain what went wrong, what was learned and how it got us to where we are today. It explores early technical issues with smart contracts, illegitimate ICOs, and rug pulls and how the ecosystem has thrived in spite of this. It will also detail the evolution of smart-contract security, DAO and auditing ecosystems. Finally, it will propose further decentralisation as a potential solution to these issues as opposed to regulation. 

I believe this topic is worth exploring in a year where regulation feels like it is at DeFi’s doorstep. A year in which there have been several unprecedented crashes (FTX, Luna). This presentation is an exploration of what went wrong and how DeFi has evolved and will promote growth in the ecosystem and remind us of its massive potential.

TL;DR
This presentation aims to highlight the growth of the DeFi ecosystem, how it has dealt with threats and how it can better defend itself in the future.|Decentralized Finance Stage|09:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Security in web3: a series of unfortunate events&dates=20230304T092000Z-07:00/20230304T094000Z-07:00)|

|Expect Privacy: The Importance of Privacy as "Table-stakes" to the Consumer|We do not shower in the middle of the town's square. 
We wrap our Christmas presents so that we can see and experience surprise. 
We time announcements and embargo for reasons that are clear to us and us alone. 
But all of these simple, every day items REQUIRE privacy as a threshold condition. Since 2004, we have become more and more accepting of the erosion of privacy in our lives. "If you don't pay for the product, you ARE the product" was an attempt to raise the level of awareness about this phenomena. However, it has not done enough. 

Privacy. Secrets. Surprise. All fundamental to the human experience. The question isn't "why should we have privacy?" it is "Who should CONTROL that privacy?" The answer is "you should". We have finally reached the stage of technological maturity where blockchains can give individuals a granular approach to setting their own boundaries for who and what they are willing to share with others. However, the consumers, the users, you and I - must make the message clear that the expectation of privacy is not a "nice to have", but rather, it is table-stakes to play in this game.|Main Stage|12:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Expect Privacy: The Importance of Privacy as "Table-stakes" to the Consumer&dates=20230303T120000Z-07:00/20230303T121500Z-07:00)|

But being able to identify the types of data most pertinent and understanding how to apply it is key to adoption. Accessing blockchains directly does not provide indexed, searchable data, so to get real value out of it, you must do all that indexing - which is incredibly complex for institutions with no crypto knowledge.

|Announcing the Web3 SDLC: Secure Development Life Cycle|There is a general lack of security experience in Web3. Currently, the only common security safeguard of Web3 companies are audits, but audits only encompass one small portion of security and at a single point in time. Because auditors are typically the only resource of security knowledge, Web3 companies rely on that knowledge for all of their security needs. While audits are a critical element in securing a protocol, they are a single line of defense, and an expensive one at that.

In this talk, we will present the Web3 SDLC, or Secure Development Life Cycle, a comprehensive security plan that Web3 companies can use to guide every step of their project. We will discuss the four phases of a project (Design, Develop, Deploy, and Defend), providing metrics that can be used to assess the security posture of a project at each phase. This does not obviate the need for an audit, but with security considered and incorporated at each phase of a project's creation, the audit can be targeted at the most technically complex features. Ultimately, incorporating security practices throughout the development process will make protocols more robust and reliable, inspiring more confidence in the protocol and its users, all at a net lower cost overall.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|15:20|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Announcing the Web3 SDLC: Secure Development Life Cycle&dates=20230302T152000Z-07:00/20230302T154000Z-07:00)|

|La Voces [the voices] of real DAO contributors: Human-centered DAO exploration|TLDR; The study delves into how people strive to meet very human needs, rearranging their work, families, and lives, to do what they do, in the ways they do them, in web3. 

The study is full of fascinating aspects, but one area that I’d like to highlight in the talk is how people meet emotional needs in web3 virtual communities. There are changes in the ways people attain a sense of belonging, as well as, purpose. This changes the way that they develop psychologically and how they feel. 

There are some things that the "outside world" could learn from the experiments that happen in DAOs. There are also some things in DAOs that prove to be lacking, such as ability to achieve a sense of stability in meeting basic needs. For example, the study shows that conditions of heightened uncertainty, cause stress, mental health side effects, and even lead to burnout. 

I will prepare a highlights reel for the talk to review a sampling from the report results & discussion chapters.

I think it’s important to spend time considering the human side of all of the change that web3 ushers in. When we study the human side, we get to know what is being received on the other side of all of this tech that we are building, to hopefully make the world better. Studies like "Las Voces of DAO Contributors" can help designers of communities, tooling, tokenomics, and participants to build for a better lived experience. These insights can also aid individual contributors to manage their engagements in the most intelligent way for them. For instance, contributors can feel validated knowing that feelings they experience are common, such as "imposture syndrome" and then find access frameworks to help them to self-advocate, even when they don't feel completely certain in their abilities.

As Las Voces prepares to release this report in 2023, we've just put up a website to answer more of people's questions about the research and how it was conducted in a scientific way. That site is available at lasvoces.co. If you catch us on a day when we are transferring the domain (happening the week this application is due), you can find the website at lasvoces.squarespace.com.

|Co-owned AI - And why DAOs are its primal form|Talk of AI in crypto is not new. But here we don't focus on the buzzwords. Instead, we consider why it is of fundamental importance for the stability of our societies that we develop means for individuals, organisations and states to co-own the most powerful AI programmes, and how crypto & Web3 plays a crucial role in this endeavour.

I will present a roadmap to co-owned AI that starts today, with DAOs and their concrete problems. And ends with a solar punk outlook on a future, enabled by equitable AI, serving us all.

The presentation will be accessible to a broad audience and involve live demonstrations of co-ownable AIs and code examples that anyone can access.|DAOS + Community Stage|17:10|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Co-owned AI - And why DAOs are its primal form&dates=20230303T171000Z-07:00/20230303T173000Z-07:00)|

|The incredible rise of Governor DAOs|In the past year, the Governor Framework has gone from powering Compound Finance to an ecosystem worth billions. Thousands of governor contracts have been deployed, hundreds of millions of dollars in value have been spent in proposals. Hundreds of thousands of people participate. It has become the de-facto standard for protocol governance. 

How did we get here? Where are we going next? 

This talk is about how a rather narrow, simple, solution to governance has spawned and ecosystem worth billions and an incredible garden of diversity in ideas, implementations, teams and structures. 

The talk will not just recap the growth of Governor, but where we go from here. How the adoption of a standard is leading to interoperability, incredible new hyper structures and truly exciting developments for DAOs.|DAOS + Community Stage|12:20|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The incredible rise of Governor DAOs&dates=20230302T122000Z-07:00/20230302T124000Z-07:00)|

|Blending the Best of Hierarchies and Networks: An Organizing Structure for DAOs|Hierarchies have been the dominant organizational structure in the most recent era of organizations due to the specific capabilities they offer. They are able to efficiently pursue and accomplish specific, well-defined ends, such as completing discrete projects and maintaining key functions for day-to-day work. And they are predictable and stable, so contributors know what they can expect, and activities can be forecast well in advance.

However, hierarchical structures are often limited in their ability to address complex and multifaceted issues. In the face of complexity, the triangular structure turns into a bottleneck. When an organizing structure is predefined and inflexible, there is little room for collective discovery, spontaneous collaboration, and unforeseen innovation.

Meanwhile, the high concentration of power within hierarchies means that certain groups at the top have enduring structural advantages and are rewarded far more compared to those lower in the organization. These structures perpetuate inequities and dissuade those with less power from fully engaging.

At their core, DAOs operate with a recognition that such a high concentration of power creates wide vectors for capture of our communal resources, and hinders our ability to pool our resources to solve our biggest problems. Consequently, DAOs have evolved to address the core issue of capture resistance, leading them to take a network approach to collaboration and favor collective decision-making over unilateral control.

Networks are very good at combining diverse perspectives to discover new possibilities, activating large numbers of people, and adapting quickly to respond to opportunities and threats. But networks—particularly as they grow large and diffuse—struggle to achieve clarity on roles and responsibilities, hold people accountable to their commitments, and explicitly delegate to and revoke authorities from individual members. As a result, they are rarely able to get things done with the same level of efficiency as hierarchical structures. This is why many DINOs (DAOs-in-name-only) have deliberately sacrificed distribution of power, and therefore capture resistance, in favor of control by an executive council.

Neither hierarchical nor network structures are sufficient on their own to meet the varied needs of DAOs, which seek to engage large numbers of people to achieve common goals while expressing the decentralization of power and the autonomy of individual actors. What's missing from DAOs is the ability to get things done without resorting to the power-over structures of traditional organizations.

The most successful DAOs of the next decade will blend the best of hierarchical and network structures in order to coordinate effectively at scale while reinforcing the autonomy of individual members. These DAOs will cultivate diverse communities of contributors that experience high degrees of trust without relying on trust to get things done. These DAOs will tap into the self-organizing potential of networks, while also creating dynamic hierarchical structures that excel in carrying out the work of the organization. They will be able to integrate the interests of the parts and the whole, coordinating multiple parts to advance the interest of the whole system, without sacrificing the autonomy of the parts in the process. This talk will describe what practices and tools DAOs can use to integrate the best of hierarchies and networks, embracing both individual autonomy and collective coordination to create a harmonious relationship between the parts and the whole.|DAOS + Community Stage|09:20|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Blending the Best of Hierarchies and Networks: An Organizing Structure for DAOs&dates=20230302T092000Z-07:00/20230302T094000Z-07:00)|

|Reversing top-down capital control - one public good at a time|"You never change things by fighting the existing reality, to change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." - Buckminster Fuller

Society has been built upon principles of capitalism. Markets are created by competing to provide the best scarce goods and resources to satisfy individual wants & needs, whatever the cost. When it comes to collective needs - public goods like education, infrastructure, healthcare, the environment - governments "take care" of them in exchange for the payment of taxes and the implementation of rules & regulations via laws.

The opportunity to provide feedback around public goods is minimal, so these "collective needs" are met from the top-down. We end up with medical care that is suited to meet the needs of pharmaceutical companies (and not necessarily the needs of the people in need of healthcare). We end up with education programs that are designed to train children to fit seamlessly into our current society models - they're trained to be good capitalists. We end up with governments taking care of the environment *only within their jurisdictions*, paying little mind to spillover into rivers that run aboard. We end up with borders, and border control that is designed to protect the interests again of their governments over respecting the freedoms of humans of the world.

Without getting to anarchist about it, we have problems in society that are not going to be solved if we continue to feed the current systems where people are dependent on governments to meet their needs, and governments are interested in meeting their needs in a way that lets them maintain the most power & capital at the top.

The solution?

Bottom-up regenerative public goods. We need our collective needs to be met while the end users are being empowered with a say in exactly how they are being met. We need regenerative funding models, so public goods are not being provided merely by donations to nonprofits or government taxes, but by market forces around this collective value creation. We need the opportunity for competition in the public goods sector, so that organizations can compete to provide what is actually the BEST for society, and so that they can be encouraged to innovate continuously.

Organizations like Giveth & Commons Stack are working to build this vision. The goal is start with nonprofits, use web3 to optimize the donation space & onboard as many high impact nonprofits as possible... then slowly support them in becoming DAOs with regenerative microeonomies.... using built & tested web3 tools.

If we want to create real change in society, we need to focus less on maintaining current systems with mild improvements (i.e. tokenized carbon credits), and instead build new systems - competing regenerative public goods microeconomies - that can actually replace what we have today.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|10:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Reversing top-down capital control - one public good at a time&dates=20230304T102000Z-07:00/20230304T104000Z-07:00)|

|High Velocity Developer Communities with NEAR DevGov DAO|Organic self-governing developer community is vital for a blockchain ecosystem. But as every blockchain rushed into throwing events and distributing grants we did not realize that we are on the bleeding edge of inventing self-governing organic financially-responsible communities. At best we learned to copy the classic OSS communities while slapping the grants program on top of it. But that frequently led to dysfunctions like slow grants process, indiscriminate funding distribution, siloed projects, to name a few.

At NEAR DevGov DAO we leveraged the fact that NEAR tech is extremely low-barrier so that engineers can engage with tinkering quicker and form huddles with discussions. We repurposed Rust tech review processes for funding distribution and have a model for facilitating brainstorming and ideation in the community.

|Apian: A Flexible Peer-to-Peer Framework for Blockchain Games|Decentralized games built on Ethereum almost all make use of a client/server architecture with the blockchain’s nodes themselves acting as the decentralized game server. Individual client dApps send commands or moves to it via transactions and then query the chain for results after those transactions are included in a block. This works well enough, but the very nature of blockchain technology places some limitations on these games. Block mining times limit the speed of player interaction, and per-move transaction costs can make it expensive to play.

Much work has been done to improve the situation, and even more is in progress. But these improvements are incremental, and as things stand now it is impractical to implement a typical casual multiplayer game with this blockchain-as-a-server architecture.

Apian is a different architecture, protocol, and mindset (plus a whole lot of code) for building, scaling, and deploying multiplayer games. Under Apian there is no game server, and instead devices running the game create a peer-to-peer network in which they all communicate with one another and collectively handle the tasks that otherwise would be a server's responsibility. Since the gameplay and consensus computations are rapidly done by the peers themselves at real-time network speeds, it is only the result of this agreement that needs to eventually be reported to the chain.

Apian’s consensus protocol implementations are separate from game code and all answer the same API. This allows each particular game to choose between any available consensus protocol on-the-fly to tailor performance/security trade-offs at runtime based on how its being played. We’ll demo a running TRON-like racing game built on Apian. 

Consensus protocol implementations under Apian are separate from game code, and all answer the same API, so a game can choose between any available consensus protocol on-the-fly at runtime. In this way it is possible to tailor performance/security trade-offs not only to a particular game, but to the situation in which a given game is being played.

To make the talk and tech real, we'll demo a proof-of-concept TRON-like racing game running multiplayer and serverless using Apian.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|11:20|2023-02-28|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Apian: A Flexible Peer-to-Peer Framework for Blockchain Games&dates=20230228T112000Z-07:00/20230228T115000Z-07:00)|

|Distributed Validation as the antidote to Staking Centralization|Not many Ethereans have both the technical knowledge AND the 32 ETH required to run a validator.
And because of it, CEXs and "curated" staking pools are growing in size and power

Decentralization is at Stake!

Distributed Validation can do for Staking what Layer 2s did for Mainnet fees, helping increase resiliency and lowering the barriers of entry for home stakers.

This talk explores "Classic DVT" and its limitations, and proposes a "DVTv2" model which offers:

- Full integration of Liquid Staking + DVT
- An economic model to guarantee a permissionless & trust-minimized design
- The advantages of pooled staking vs solo staking
- Its connection to MEV and the future of staking|Decentralized Finance Stage|11:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Distributed Validation as the antidote to Staking Centralization&dates=20230303T110000Z-07:00/20230303T112000Z-07:00)|

|zkOps for Optimized Deployment of zk Computational Workloads|There is great excitement surrounding the potential applications for newly-introduced zero knowledge (zk) proof systems. However, today, there are barriers to mass adoption of zk verifiable computing: zk proof generation involves many end-user mathematical choices; is computationally intense, and; leverages a wide array of software languages and libraries. Accordingly, widespread adoption of zk will require additional practical, operational infrastructure. We call this infrastructure zkOps.

This talk describes current zk deployment strategies and future avenues for zkOps tooling. Since both zk proofs and many Web2 workloads fundamentally rely on computation, there are parallels between existing Web2 devops infrastructure and future zkOps tools; we compare and contrast these techniques during this discussion.

Finally, our goal in this talk is to engage with the developer community and share our work-in-progress zkOps contributions. Our tools allow dapp and infrastructure developers to efficiently integrate zk proofs into their workflows. Using our tools, zkOps deployment pipelines are supported by optimally-selected hardware and software for enhanced scalability, performance, and reliability.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|15:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=zkOps for Optimized Deployment of zk Computational Workloads&dates=20230303T150000Z-07:00/20230303T152000Z-07:00)|

|How to build next-generation DeFi Apps|This talk will focus on scaling Ethereum developer infrastructure that can be easily used to create DeFi applications, further boost user experience and improve efficiency to enable wider adoption of Ethereum. 

Injective has firsthand experience in building Ethereum developer scaling solutions and enabling new value transfer into Ethereum from new ecosystems such as Cosmos. Developers can leverage Injective's decentralized plug-and-play infrastructures to build innovative applications. The talk will aim to show how to use new cross-chain infrastructure to build dApps, how to leverage different DeFi primitives to create dApps, and how to bring more value and users to Ethereum. 

Injective is an open, interoperable layer-one blockchain for building powerful DeFi applications. Injective uniquely provides plug-and-play financial infrastructure primitives, such as a high-performance on-chain decentralized exchange infrastructure, decentralized bridges, oracles, and a composable smart contract layer with CosmWasm. Injective's network is highly interoperable, with over 10 prominent layer-one blockchains such as Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and much more, becoming the primary gateway for developers to create cross-chain dApps.

In addition, the developer environment on Ethereum is becoming increasingly accessible due to new tooling available so the talk will shed light into some of these developer tools and how easy it is now to build around the Ethereum ecosystem using a robust set of languages such as Solidity, Go, Rust, and much more.

The talk will also delve into the technical upgrades coming up within the crypto ecosystem that developers can leverage to build their own dApps and enable more seamless cross-chain transfers with Etheruem across both the L1 and L2 ecosystems.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|10:10|2023-02-26|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How to build next-generation DeFi Apps&dates=20230226T101000Z-07:00/20230226T103500Z-07:00)|

|Single Player-Ready Dapps|Imagine if the restaurant review site Yelp was truly decentralized, that you had your single player-ready instance that was just for you, and you felt free to share your most private thinking on how you felt about a dining experience. You could then turn on multiplayer, and share just the parts you want to your organization's or family's instance. Perhaps your organization belongs to a superset of organizations, such as a coalition--you could share to there too with the right settings. The point is that you are the data owner, and the buck stops with you, but you're also free to federate into larger fractals to your heart's content. This is what a Single Player-Ready Dapp is. Social media sites could work the same way, allowing you to export your entire social media graph seamlessly. Then you can use the blockchain to govern these federations and access financial services such as payments, all without intermediaries. All this is possible very soon, and will be convenient for dapps to become "single player-ready".

|How to know what you're users really want|Building products for users is hard. It's even harder if you assume you know everything about the user and think you know exactly what they want. Building great products and features often takes multiple iterations, and for most projects, you don't have the time or money to get it wrong over and over again. One of the most common mistakes in web3, and in-particular DeFi, is designing the user facing product around the technical details and capabilities of the protocol(s), instead of understanding what you're users actually want, and what job they want to get done. In this talk, we will talk about the different ways you can go from assumptions you hold to testing your theories and early designs, and how to ask the right questions. In particular, we will focus on the Jobs to be Done framework, how you can convert your user needs into jobs, and how you can design the right tools to get the job done. By the end of the talk, the hope is that we as an industry will be better placed to build better user facing products with hugely better UX than we have today - something web3 and crypto desperetly needs more than almost anything else.|Decentralized Finance Stage|10:00|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How to know what you're users really want&dates=20230302T100000Z-07:00/20230302T102000Z-07:00)|

|Data Composability on the Sovereign Web|A central pillar of the Web3 vision is ‘composable data’; the idea that the information that powers our online experiences can be read, remixed, and 'composed on' by applications across the web. This reusable model is in contrast to today's model, where data is primarily trapped in application-specific siloes.

Composable data is a paradigm shift for how the web works because it not only changes ***how*** applications are built but ***what*** an application is. Ethereum and ERC standards paved the way for permissionless innovation and composability across smart contracts, but the next frontier of decentralization will require technology that can power an ecosystem of composable, data-rich applications. 

This talk will provide developers with real-world applications and demos that showcase the power and innovation of decentralized data applications, and clear steps for how to use brand new tools in the Web3 data stack to build full data composability into their products. We’ll show you how live apps are already doing this to:

- Supercharge coordination in teams and DAOs

|Decentralization without chaos: how DAOs (and every other org) can effectively decentralize and make better decisions|Decentralization is the key to the future success of Web3. 

Why?

Web3 will succeed when it both outperforms the capabilities of Web2 organizations, and adds capabilities that Web2 organizations can’t have. 

Outperforming Web2 organizations comes down to attracting the best talent, executing quickly, and creating technology and innovations that outperform Web2. I’ll argue that none of those will be possible without effective decentralization, which divorces control and ownership and takes advantage of blockchain technologies.

The capabilities of Web3 organizations that Web2 doesn’t have are primarily token-based (both financialized and non-financialized tokens). Deploying and managing those assets legally requires* decentralized decision making. Web3 will simply fail to reach its potential without succeeding at decentralization.

I believe that we’re in a come-to-Jesus moment in an industry on decentralization, and I want this talk to be the come-to-Jesus conversation. We’re going to explore what it actually means to be decentralized and why it doesn’t mean chaos. Even if we haven’t found actual decentralization in DAOs yet, we’re going to look at other organizations — from the Iroquois Confederacy, the 1970’s women’s movement, and political interest groups — to practical examples of companies like Patagonia, Bob’s Red Mill, and The Ready that are all more decentralized (and profitable) than most DAOs.

I want to leave the audience with three things:
- The time to take decentralization seriously is now;
- How to solve the most common mistake in decentralization today: focusing on defining solutions, rather than problems, through governance;
- Decentralization is going to make things better than you’ve imagined.

|Budgeting for All: How to Make Crypto Cities a Reality|Budgeting for All (a.k.a., full-scale participatory budgeting) is a blueprint for truly decentralized crypto cities because it is predicated on direct democracy first, the blockchain second. It would be the most—or rather, the only—equitable manifestation of Web3 thus far in the realm of city policy.

This presentation is an adaptation of my Zora Zine essay "Appetite for Redistribution: Budgeting for All".

|Social Media to the People - Envisioning how decentralized technologies can give us social media governed by the public|Who gets to censor what you say online? Who gets to decide what you do or don't get see? The recent chaos swirling around Twitter and Facebook has drawn the public's attention to critical questions around how we govern our social media platforms and how those governance questions shape our information environment. Decentralized technologies and participatory decentralized approaches to addressing social media challenges can provide alternative solutions to seemingly intractable arguments about how our social platforms operate, but only if we build the next generation of social platforms with governance at the core.|Impact + Public Goods Stage|15:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Social Media to the People - Envisioning how decentralized technologies can give us social media governed by the public&dates=20230303T150000Z-07:00/20230303T152000Z-07:00)|
|Account Abstraction for Everyone Else: The Race to The Missing Piece for Adoption|Account abstraction is gaining more and more visibility in the community as a key feature missing for Ethereum, and blockchains in general, to reach the point of adoption by the general public. Once hailed as something that could/should only be done at the protocol level, account abstraction is now being tackled by different teams at the L2 and application levels. Account abstraction unlocks a few key features that would elevate web3 UX to a more usable and familiar feeling of web2 UX: executing some action when preconditions are met and letting EOAs have guaranteed, known behavior, like contracts, to name a few. You can also do other interesting things like paying gas fees for other users, using different signature schemes, and more.

This talk will be an overview of account abstraction for people who may not be familiar with it as it was proposed and will walk through how different teams are working toward implementing a form of account abstraction. This talk will also uniquely focus on the *outcomes* of real humans of account abstraction instead of just a technical talk with no context for how it can affect users.|Bunny Slopes|13:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Account Abstraction for Everyone Else: The Race to The Missing Piece for Adoption&dates=20230304T132000Z-07:00/20230304T134000Z-07:00)|

|Automatically Strengthening Formal DeFi Specifications using Program Mutations|Formal verification is an effective technique for ensuring DeFi security. It assists humans in finding bugs before the code is deployed and can formally prove many program invariants. Formal verification is particularly relevant in the domain of smart contracts where vulnerabilities in the code can lead to severe financial losses. In this talk, we will show how a formal verification tool we have built, called the Certora Prover, can be used to prove high-level properties of Solidity smart contracts. The Certora Prover has already secured billions of dollars by verifying millions of lines of Solidity code.
 
One of the most important steps in formal verification is writing a good specification against which the program is verified. Writing good specifications can be challenging and may cause the results of formal verification to lead to false beliefs about software correctness. This talk will also present a new mutation-based tool, dubbed Gambit, for strengthening the quality of formal specifications and therefore gaining trust in the result of formal verification. We show cases where mutations can find missing parts of the specifications.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|09:40|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Automatically Strengthening Formal DeFi Specifications using Program Mutations&dates=20230303T094000Z-07:00/20230303T100000Z-07:00)|

|The RPC Trilemma|Reliability, Performance and Cost are the three pillars of building an RPC Service. We were promised light clients, but got a market of centralized node runners, and we’re going to land somewhere in between.

Reliability - Data consistency (I.e. data integrity), uptime (i.e. crash fault tolerance) and availability (i.e. sanction tolerance) is the foundation we need.

Performance - Low latency and a quick round-trip time are the sexy numbers everyone cares about.

Cost - An RPC service needs to be cheap to use, easy to access, and have the lowest possible operating costs possible.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|09:40|2023-03-02|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The RPC Trilemma&dates=20230302T094000Z-07:00/20230302T100000Z-07:00)|

I will also demonstrate the practical implementation of Shamir Secret Sharing in a crypto wallet infrastructure, providing examples of SDKs and code snippets that developers can use. I will discuss the trade-offs and considerations of using other mainstream wallet solutions, such as MPC wallets, mnemonic wallets, and smart contract wallets.

This talk will be valuable for anyone interested in onboarding the next generation of crypto users by creating a smooth user experience in decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custodial wallets.

|Fluence Workshop|Deploying decentralized blockchain RPC for your dapp using Fluence serverless.

​Running blockchain nodes to support your dApps' RPC reqirements tends to be rather resource intensive. Not surprisingly, Web3 developers tend to gravitate toward using hosted blockchain gateways, aka RPC, solutions. Alas, "RPC as SaaS" introduces centralized bottlenecks challenging the availability, reliability and ethos of dApps.

​Fluence, a decentralized FaaS stack, provides a ready-to-use decentralized RPC (fRPC) solution to empower dApp developers to quickly and efficiently integrate decentralized RPC calls into their dApps. Moreover, USDC 11,000 are available to developers using and hacking on fRPC during the EthDenver 2023 hackathon.

​This workshop provides an overview of Fluence's open, decentralized FaaS protocol and available open source tooling. Moreover, we'll dive into the nitty gritty of fRPC and how to integrate fRP into your dApps. Finally, we discuss the available bounties.

|What’s The Best Next Move? On-Chain Connect 4|Creating DAO governance models can often feel like you’re playing a strategy game. What’s the best next move?

Join the team at Fractal for an on-chain Connect 4 game that mirrors real-world DAO governance. Each team will be led by the (perceived) best Connect 4 player (aka ParentDAO), with the remaining team members (ChildDAO) playing as equal shareholders. During the game, participants submit and vote on proposals for the best next move, while the ParentDAO acts like any good parent, freezing the child if they believe a terrible move has been proposed.

The game will challenge the state of DAO governance and encourage participants to think differently about on-chain decision-making.

During the session, learn about Fractal’s mission – amplify the power of decentralized human coordination. Fractal has just launched V1 of its DAO governance framework that empowers flexible DAO creation into composable subDAO hierarchies with their own governance and treasury that are extensible by design.

Fractal is being incubated by Decent DAO, an on-chain venture studio focused on creating more sustainable, long-term economic systems.

|ZPrize: Optimizing Hardware to Advance Zero-knowledge Applications / ZPrize: Advancing ZKPs Through Open Source Hardware Developments|Celebrate one year of ZPrize! 

ZPrize was created following ar meeting of the leading ZKP and web3 minds at ETH Denver ‘22. The idea: create an industry-wide competition to accelerate ZK hardware development and advance the deployment of ZKPs. In March 2022, ZPrize was born. The launch of ZPrize united the leading web3 and ZKP projects with traditional hardware behemoths like Samsung and AMD to create and open source new solutions for ZK hardware acceleration. 32 sponsors contributed $7M to fund 12 prizes, and 70 unique competitors competed in the various categories. The results of this competition presented a significant breakthrough in hardware performance that improved efficiency of core zero-knowledge algorithms by a factor of 5, on average. Because ZPrize focuses on fundamental algorithms instead of a specific company or protocol, these results are broadly applicable and all of the work will be open-sourced for the industry to build and iterate upon.

Our goal is to take zero-knowledge cryptography beyond the realms of theory and research and squarely into the realm of practical applications— from digital stablecoins, privacy-preserving machine learning, digital identity, gaming and more. 

Join the half-day ZPrize summit dedicated to building more mature ZK infrastructure and an ecosystem that fosters true innovation. Meet the founders, competitors, architects, and partners of ZPrize and hear from the leading voices at the intersection of ZKP and web3 who are making ZKP a reality.

|Your Wallet Isn’t Safe|We all think we know good wallet security, especially when it comes to keeping addresses separate on chain. But the current approach to RPC calls means all your hard work is for nothing.
HOPR founder Dr Sebastian Bürgel shows:

- How your addresses certainly aren't private and are at risk of being linked, spearphished and worse.
- How your Metamask is leaking your secrets even if you never unlock it with your password.
- How your VPN isn't enough to keep you safe.

Finally, we'll share a new approach to RPC calls that can finally make your wallet and data safe, including your IP address!

|Don't Trust, Verify What's At Stake|Transparency has never been more important to those of us who have been in the space for a while and others who are just getting started.

As the first public company to stake a large sum of ether (36,000 ETH), we learned firsthand about the lack of sufficient data pipelines that made it difficult to meet certain auditing requirements.

That's when we decided to build our staking dashboard — a custom solution that allows us to track our staking rewards, gives us direct insight into our validators performance and aggregates data into one easy-to-use platform saving us both time and money.

No matter how you decide to stake your ETH, it's important to have a holistic view of your entire operation. Know immediately when your validators go offline or are slashed, stay on top of your rewards and have access to financial data at your fingertips that can make filing taxes a breeze.

Come join our presentation to hear about the challenges we encountered when staking and how to ensure you have the necessary tools to stake responsibly, enable diversification and access all of the information you want, when you want.

|The Key to On-Chain Messaging: Building Communication and Engagement Right in the Wallet with Dispatch and Zerion|Over the past few years, web3 founders and developers have brought a huge range of innovative projects to the market, constantly innovating and experimenting to bring new use cases for their communities to the market.

So what’s the next stage of engagement for these project? Once you engage an audience and they buy your NFT or token, how do you stay top of mind? How do you really go from “customer” to “community”?

In this hands-on workshop, developers and no-coders alike will have the opportunity to explore the fundamentals of one-to-many web3-native messaging services. In short, we will teach attendees how to use on-chain messaging for both one-way community communications and branded on-chain engagement and activations.

Workshop topics include:
- One-to-Many on-chain messaging: features and capabilities
- Community activation and governance: How to incorporate token-based messaging into your community’s growth strategy
- A look under the hood: Wallet rendering and protocol details

When you need to reach your community, you need something more reliable than a tweet into the void or a Discord channel that reaches only a fraction of your holders. While these platforms serve as helpful onramps and stopgap solutions, the next generation of web3 projects needs a more granular yet secure form of online communication. Adopting web3-native messaging services will ultimately benefit individual and institutional netizens alike.|Vib Hotel Workshop|09:00|2023-02-28|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Key to On-Chain Messaging: Building Communication and Engagement Right in the Wallet with Dispatch and Zerion&dates=20230228T090000Z-07:00/20230228T103000Z-07:00)|

|Cracking Nanopayments: how to transmit tiny amounts of value using probability|Imagine the possibilities if you could send a tiny payment with every data packet you send. Long an elusive "white whale" in the crypto, payments, and finance spaces, nanopayments are a way to send infinitesimal value from one to many parties. Orchid recently developed an API so you can build with the same technology that powers the bandwidth marketplace. 

Come learn about what is possible Orchid’s fascinating layer-2 technology.

|Better UX is the key to expanding crypto – but how do we bring that to life?|Everyone says that UX is the biggest barrier to Web3 adoption. But how do we bring that to life? Thoughtful design that puts the user first.

|It's not you, it's crypto.|What crypto builders need to consider and what newbs have to look forward to…

As an industry, we have chosen to create linguistic and physical barriers to entry and organizations building in crypto will need to adopt a change in perspective if they want to bring more than just technical experts to use their platforms. The original intention of crypto was to shift traditional power structures in the name of a frictionless global economy. The first step crypto platforms must take towards creating a more inclusive system is to reduce the barriers to access that are prolific within the industry today.

My talk walks through the following:

1. A brief background of my career in digital and financial inclusion, having been responsible for driving user onboarding and adoption of complex technologies (anecdote: I’ve taught the Amish how to do business transactions with iPads)
2. What is financial inclusion?
3. Why something like Defi has the innate power to reduce barriers to access
4. The gap between where crypto is today vs its potential (spoiler alert: we’re far from it)
5. How far? (show examples of how todays technologies use sophisticated reading levels, countless acronyms, a crypto-specific lexicon that doesn’t exist in the dictionary. 
6. Decentralized platforms = decentralized support (and 5 reasons why this is inhibiting growth and adoption)
7. What can builders do about this? Aka what can users expect in the next year or two?
    1. Relatable stories that explain the real-word use cases (that people *actually* get excited about)
    2. Increased usability
    3. More accessibility
    4. Nurture trust and security|DAOS + Community Stage|17:40|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=It's not you, it's crypto.&dates=20230304T174000Z-07:00/20230304T180000Z-07:00)|
|Building Interoperable Permissionless Games with HyperPlay|Web3 gaming is more than secondary markets for in-game items. Diablo 3 had that over a decade ago, and it didn't need a blockchain to accomplish it. 

This talk will explore why we need interoperable game worlds where assets can be permissionlessly carried across the decentralized web and where gaming universes can be extended by the community. 

This talk will cover how builders can implement this vision using HyperPlay, a web3-native game launcher and aggregator of game stores. HyperPlay allows players to discover and install any game from the Epic Store, GOG, or HyperPlay's own store, and integrates with MetaMask and WalletConnect for simple in-game transactions, even in native desktop games. Both native desktop games and browser games are supported. Developers can implement in-game transactions, and are free from de-platforming and Apple-tax fees.|Main Stage|13:55|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Building Interoperable Permissionless Games with HyperPlay&dates=20230304T135500Z-07:00/20230304T141000Z-07:00)|
|Why and how to leverage L2 to build secure, low-cost, globally available dapps OR Scaling Ethereum for Global Adoption with L2|Coinbase is one of the largest crypto companies in the world and we are increasingly migrating our products, users, and assets onchain.

|The next billion users in DeFi|Latin America and Africa present a unique opportunity for crypto and Web3. The two continent’s history has been turbulent, and the majority of people know all too well what it feels like to get “rugged” by their governments whether it be through rampant inflation, restrictive monetary policy, or blatant corruption. Yet, with a combination of a large online population, a growing pool of talented developers, and the desire to improve their situation there is fertile soil for crypto and web3 to take root. 
Many of the industry’s most influential figures are noticing this. Binance Founder and CEO CZ made a surprise appearance at a recent conference to announce the exchange’s plan to expand into Brazil. CZ is meeting with government officials in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as he eyes where to set up shop for his Brazilian headquarters.
In addition, heavyweights Coinbase, Crypto.com, and others are attempting to expand in the territories too.
Furthermore, the varied economic situation in each country in these two large continents affect how the populations interact with cryptocurrency. This uncertain environment has spurred these citizens to prioritize the immediate future and utilize cryptocurrency for its practical use as a currency.|Decentralized Finance Stage|17:30|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The next billion users in DeFi&dates=20230303T173000Z-07:00/20230303T180000Z-07:00)|

|VMs: Translating Modular Scalability into Application Usability|The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the VM/EVM development in Web3 and the historical product development that has been made in the space in the past 2 years and how that development will impact (1) developer user experience (2) end user experience. 

I will discuss how the impacts of the compiler development in Fuel's VM/EVMs in the space. I will dive into how it will be reflected in composable contract interactions, wallets (i.e. Asset Right Abstractions in Wallets, Programmable Authentication) application level interactions with on-chain event data (Block Explorers, Decentralized Social Networks, Aggregate Governance Analytics, Dex Agreggators, etc.), and how Fraud Proofs, Validity Proofs, and scalability development as a whole has affected interfaces in the past. 

This workshop will break down the different types of compilers, their architectural and runtime differences, the history of compiler development (outside of the blockchain space), the VM and EVM wars, and the future impacts on application level development. 

This workshop is aimed to empower and educate more interface level designers to understand the infrastructure and scalability space on a deeper technical level.|#BUIDL Palace|11:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=VMs: Translating Modular Scalability into Application Usability&dates=20230303T110000Z-07:00/20230303T113000Z-07:00)|
|Remote Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM|Last year at EthDenver, I demoed cross chain asset transfers with XCM. This year, I'm excited to demo an even bigger breakthrough, namely, remote EVM calls via XCM. With remote cross-chain EVM calls now live on the testnet, devs can now send an XCM message from a remote chain containing a contract call to be executed on Moonbeam's EVM. 

In this workshop, I'll introduce the technical bits of how XCM works and how remote EVM calls work. We'll go through the steps of generating a derivative account on Moonbeam that we'll control remotely via XCM. Then, we'll jump into crafting our remote EVM call - we'll initiate a swap on a Uniswap-style Dex to take place all from a remote chain. I'm so excited about demoing this because it represents the vision of seamless cross-chain interoperability coming to life. I'll be sure to leave time at the end of the workshop for Q&A - as this is a complex topic I expect at least a few questions :)|#BUIDL Palace|11:30|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Remote Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM&dates=20230303T113000Z-07:00/20230303T120000Z-07:00)|
|Emergent Behavior in DeFi: Agent Based Simulations and Reinforcement Learning|As in any complex system there may be emergent behaviors in DeFi protocols. In this workshop we will show the basics of how agent based simulations combined with reinforcement learning can be used to explore these and also for optimization of various protocol parameter values. 

We will begin with an introduction to Vega Protocol itself before moving on to discuss how we have used agent-based modelling to both test the protocol itself and investigate behaviour under differing conditions 
to inform design and configuration decisions.

From this baseline, we will then guide participants in setting up and running preconfigured simulations with Vega Protocol. Once we are all set up, and depending upon audience interests, we can then work through more custom setups with either a focus on Reinforcement Learning or testing trading strategies in a realistic living market.

This workshop will be based on https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega-market-sim with additional references to https://github.com/msabvid/cpm_agent_based_sim. 

Working through the setup on the Vega Market Sim repo will give a great headstart in the workshop.|#BUIDL Palace|13:00|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Emergent Behavior in DeFi: Agent Based Simulations and Reinforcement Learning&dates=20230303T130000Z-07:00/20230303T133000Z-07:00)|
|What kind of space? An interactive discussion of the why and what of moderation in a decentralized world|This is an interactive workshop - starting with a dicussion of what moderation means in a decentralized space, and including an overview of methodologies from shared blocklists to SBTs to trust web architectures.  

It is open to general audience because it is important for tech folks who are implementing moderation solutions to understand and engage with all types of community members on an equal basis.

The workshop will start with a quick overview of content moderation and privacy considerations (maybe including a run thru the techdirt "speedrun" article) and a full group discussion.  A list of projects in the space will be provided for context.   If there are enough participants it will then break into small groups unconference style on subjects such as policy formation, shared blocklist and greylist formats, open signed trust claims, based on existing projects in the ecosystem..  We will record the small group outputs and provide them as feedback to the projects discussed.

The list of possible projects for discussion will include

- TrustWeb (Harlan Wood's project on Holochain)
-  Shared greylists on matrix
- Levels of block/silencing on Fediverse
- Blockchain solutions such as Orange Protocol
- SBTs in theory and practice
- Verifiable Credentials as Trust Claims

Also we will include a remote participation element for people who are impacted by these situations and were not able to afford to attend Eth Denver.|#BUIDL Palace|13:30|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=What kind of space?

|Craft a Compelling Narrative for Your Web3 Grant Proposal|The most common mistake I see on grant applications?

They lack a compelling narrative. There's no hook!

Grants program managers read a LOT of grant proposals. If you want them to seriously consider yours, you need to get their attention immediately.

The intro to your proposal needs to present a compelling narrative for your project. Immediately. Right from the start.

There's a simple, three-step formula that you can follow. But there is also an art to writing about your project to compel support from the person reading your application.

In this workshop, I present the three-step formula and then work alongside web3 project founders to polish the narrative for each of their grant proposals.|1029 Santa Fe Drive Denver, CO 80204|23:55|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Craft a Compelling Narrative for Your Web3 Grant Proposal&dates=20230303T235500Z-07:00/20230303T002500Z-07:00)|

|Your Web2 data stinks; it's time for an upgrade.|Web2 data is untrustworthy at best, and nefarious at worst. We currently live in a society where we cannot trust anything that isn’t directly from the source, because moral hazards incentivize lying and cheating. And there’s so much value in selling data about individuals that we’ve all come to accept the fact that ‘we are the product’.

Web3 data solves those problems. Web3 data is immutable, and blockchain explorers let you see how data is used and changed over time, with every party signing their activity. Web3 data also has an economic value assigned to it by default, enabling fair data economies for everything from scientific research to gaming.

At Weavechain, we enable legacy databases to be upgraded to manage Web3 data, providing an easy solution that maintains compliance. Unfortunately public Web3 isn’t GDPR or HIPAA compliant, and it never will be.

|Pushing the Boundaries of Web3 UX|Problem:

Today crypto sits at a crossroads. After a tough 2022, more than ever web3 needs to demonstrate a clear value proposition to bring in the next generation of builders, investors and developers. One way to do this is by making interactions with web3 as seamless, user-friendly and accessible as the platforms and services they use and are familiar with from web2.

Solution:

Push Protocol is building web3’s communication layer. Notifications drive everything that people do across web2, whether it is checking emails, checking social media, uploading pictures or buying something from Amazon. Notifications drive user interaction from the moment a person engages with their phone or computer to the moment they get a reply, or their delivery arrives.

We are bringing this type of functionality to web3. In October we announced the launch of wallet-to-wallet messaging through Push Chat, and today we can announce that Group Chat is now ready to roll out to users - you heard it here first.

Group chat will drive even more engagement in the web3 space, opening the door to even greater use as we work towards our objective of helping bring one billion people into the web3 space.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|12:40|2023-02-25|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Pushing the Boundaries of Web3 UX&dates=20230225T124000Z-07:00/20230225T130000Z-07:00)|
|Saving Web3 Protocols from the fate of Web2 Companies|This talk will focus on showcasing the challenges of relying on centralized cloud providers, and the promise of decentralized cloud infrastructure for protocols. It will have charts, numbers and analysis to back up all claims. It's important that Web3 protocols are not just decentralized in name but decentralized in infrastructure for costs, resiliency and performance. Summary below: 

Cloud is one of the greatest shifts in the history of computing. For the first time in history, organizations didn’t have to deal with the technical burden and costs of running their own infrastructure. Instead, they could rely entirely on a cloud that offered infrastructure on-demand, at any scale, to organizations of any size, driving efficiencies and economics. The cloud industry is growing rapidly growing rapidly on a base of over $100B of annual public cloud spend. 

Yet, what started out as the most efficient and economical way to scale has become the largest area of spend for many Web2, and dare I say Web3 companies operating at scale. We will get to Web3, but first, focusing on Web2. The longterm cost implications of shifting entirely to cloud is costing Web2 companies billions of dollars each year. “Across 50 of the top public software companies, an estimated $100B of market value is being lost among them due to cloud impact on margins.” a16z. They could be saving billions of dollars they had run their own infrastructure or taken a hybrid approach to their infrastructure. Not only is it a challenge when it comes to costs, but these organizations get cloud vendor lock-in, and it’s difficult to move their tech stack or start from scratch once they’ve reached scale. 

Web3 protocols are in their early days, and the decisions they make when it comes to infrastructure is critical. Many protocols today are dealing with the same challenges that Web2 companies face with large cloud providers, and they are looking for ways to decentralize while they try to scale or die. There are challenges with operating costs, lock-in and an inability to operate efficiently with the hardware that cloud providers offer. Web3 protocols and their infrastructure ecosystem (node runners, operators, shakers, future zk provers, etc.) have to consider not only the short term ease of spinning up on a cloud provider, but the longterm implications for their protocol. 

This talk will start off by covering the above, and then it will go into an analysis of different infrastructure options and their associated challenges, benefits, costs. In contrast to the centralized cloud providers Web2 companies and many Web3 companies rely on to start running infrastructure, there is are infrastructure options that are decentralized, align with the values of Web3 while saving protocols money now and in the future. 

This will not highlight any specific Web3 company -- just compare and contrast data and analysis of different infrastructure options.|Bunny Slopes|12:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Saving Web3 Protocols from the fate of Web2 Companies&dates=20230304T120000Z-07:00/20230304T122000Z-07:00)|

|Future-Proofing Wallets for Web3|As blockchain becomes a ubiquitous technology layer that underpins future consumer and enterprise applications, the need to future proof its design and user experience has become mission critical. Not only will users expect to be able to manage and interact with thousands of different assets across multiple blockchains, but they will be keen to choose a winner with competitive offerings that are as intuitive as it it secure

Brandon Millman, CEO and Co-Founder of Phantom, the non-custodial crypto wallet available for Ethereum, Polygon and Solana, will explore how to future proof the web3 wallet experience to stay ahead of  the adoption cycle; what developers need to keep in mind as they’re building new interfaces and tech stacks, how these wallets will interact with and complement new and future user interfaces, and the importance of intuitive product experiences. Millman will provide insights on how to future-proof wallets across the industry to keep up with the requirements and challenges that developers face today.|Bunny Slopes|15:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Future-Proofing Wallets for Web3&dates=20230304T150000Z-07:00/20230304T152000Z-07:00)|
|How do you monitor a decentralized network?  Performance and Adoption on IPFS, libp2p and Ceramic ComposeDB|This talk will cover challenges and solutions for monitoring decentralized user behavior on Ceramic Mainnet, with specific aspects of IPFS, libp2p and individual node metrics.  Both adoption tracking and performance and alerting will be considered.  If node operators share metrics, can you trust them?  Finally we will touch on the related subject of reputation on a decentralized network, and a proposal for how to voluntarily share metric and reputation information.

The challenges of large centralized companies apply to decentralized ecosystems as well.  The need for reliability guarantees, to be able to predict behavior of the network and also content decision making of node operators, is just as necessary for participants in a decentralized network - only the decision making is not uniform.  

We will examine live data from the ceramic network that is not normally exposed to the public, share code patterns for observability and provide an option for participating in a shared data layer of monitoring and information.

Information can lead to adoption - part of this talk will be how exposing metrics on usage leads to adoption of shared models, and how developers can be involved in the shared data ecosystem.

We will also address nascent challenges of content moderation and how node operators in the decentralized space may have more, not less, responsibility when no central authority exists, and how to balance privacy guarantees with content decisions.|Bunny Slopes|14:20|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=How do you monitor a decentralized network?

|Building A Sharable DID Network Using Zero Knowledge Technology|Today everyone's social identity data are monopolized by governments, big web 2 companies like Facebook/Wechat, and big crypto companies like Binance or Coinbase. Everyone is contributing their data, but no one can utilize them without the permission of the centralized controller. 

If a KOL gets kicked out from the platform, they are left with nothing. All the users are accumulated and controlled by the platform.
With blockchain and Zero Knowledge technologies, we are able to build out a network that let users to submit and share their Web 2&3 ID in a zero knowledge way. Also users are able to truly control the permission and ownership of their data. 
We understand the importance of decentralization but meanwhile we also know our world could not be 100% web3 yet. Web2 and web3 will coexist for a long time, and we need to build the bridge between them. Some data are unique in the web2 sense, such as KYC info. Lots of people still rely heavily on apps like Twitter, telegram, and email for communicating. 

By bridging the web2 data into web3 world under each one’s wallet address with privacy, the web3 world will be filled with richer and higher degree data

With blockchain and Zero Knowledge technologies, we are able to build out a network that let users upload any data, starting Web 2 ID, to their wallet addresses, in a zero knowledge way.

|No one wants privacy (yet)!|Despite the crypto community in outrage over Tornado Cash and members fighting in court for our right to privacy- we (Nucleo) have proof points that as a whole, most of the communities and users we've worked with don't want privacy (yet)!

What's our support?
From our 2 fundraisers that allowed private and public donations, individual private donations were only ~15% compared to public. From our work on privacy tools with DAOs and organizations, there's been heavy skepticism of introducing any privacy into the orgs as people love Dune Dashboards and orgs being able to be tracked as well as whales and snooping.
From beta testing with individual users to general stats on Aztec Connect for private DeFi (only about 1/5th the size of ZK Sync), there is clear evidence that privacy does not have the same traction as others.

So then the question is why? Most cited is:
•     Regulatory Risk
	- People we have worked with - spanning from DAOs to Sotheby’s to Market Makers to Chainalysis to individual users have cited fears of getting an address blacklisted just for using any sort of privacy because of the OFAC sanctions

•	User Education
	- Privacy is a spectrum and most users do not know the differences in privacy offered between pseudonymous chains like ETH/BTC, mixnets, L1 contracts like Tornado Cash, L2 Zk rollups like zk sync, L2 ZK-ZK rollups like Aztec
	- Most users do not know the limits of existing privacy tools on these spectrums and the technical areas being worked on from account level privacy with audit keys to proof of reserves to configurable asset privacy - everything and every tool is just being marketed as PRIVATE with no differentiation explained

•	Technical Work to be done to make privacy as easy as can be
	- Piggy backing on the last point - there is still a ton of work to be done to make the types of privacy most consumers have been asking for AND to make it as easy and usable as existing non-privacy tech. Walk through one technical example of ZKP over many notes for refund hitting max data limit sizes and needing to SNARK pack notes to prove

So does this mean privacy is dead? We will all just continue to exist in a surveillance state?
No! The great news is that there’s work being done in all 3 areas :)

On Regulatory risk
•	fantastic folks like Coinbase and Bankless are fighting for our rights and legal clarity around rights to privacy while folks like Aztec have built more advanced account based privacy systems that don’t mix funds in with any stolen funds so no need to worry there

On education
•	We are working on this and it’s why we are here! We need more people to spread the word and would love to get more people in on it!

On technical work to be done to make privacy as easy as can be
•	We are also working on this and are confident we will get there and would love to work with anyone interested in making this happen :)|Main Stage|11:45|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=No one wants privacy (yet)!&dates=20230303T114500Z-07:00/20230303T120000Z-07:00)|

|Are Wallets Actually Working?|Bear markets allow us to pause and ask ourselves whether we are on the right path. Are wallets really working today? Are they really on track to usher in the next 10 million users? What is their role in crypto today, how did they get here, and what do we expect it to be in 10 years?

This talk will examine the fundamentals - how we’ve come to accept many things that are broken, how we’re how we are building in markets with large artificial silos of data, and how wallets can potentially bring in a more formidable future for users, if executed correctly.

|The Third Way: Alternatives to PoW and PoS|The talk will be broken into three parts. Part I will present some helpful background information for context. It'll introduce the notion of a consensus mechanism with "real world" examples like the ones mentioned above (e.g., driving a car) and a little bit of history from distributed systems and from blockchain. Part II will present the tradeoffs between PoW and PoS: the history, the strengths and weaknesses of each system, with a bit of Ethereum history, Ethereum's motivation for switching, and a discussion of the Merge and how the Eth Beacon chain works. Part III will present some "outside the box" alternatives to PoW and PoS, such as Solana's "proof of history" and Spacemesh/Chia/Filecoin's approach using proofs of space-time. Again, the tradeoffs around these mechanisms will be discussed and they'll be presented in the context of running, production networks. The conclusion will talk about implications for the application layer and for dapp developers: ways in which the consensus mechanism "leaks" through the abstraction boundaries and impacts UX and DevEx, and ways in which applications themselves can make use of consensus.|Infrastructure + Scalability Stage|13:20|2023-03-03|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=The Third Way: Alternatives to PoW and PoS&dates=20230303T132000Z-07:00/20230303T134000Z-07:00)|

|Building Interoperable Permissionless Games with HyperPlay (Workshop)|Web3 gaming is more than secondary markets for in-game items. Diablo 3 had that over a decade ago, and it didn't need a blockchain to accomplish it. 

This talk will explore why we need interoperable game worlds where assets can be permissionlessly carried across the decentralized web and where gaming universes can be extended by the community. 

This talk will cover how builders can implement this vision using HyperPlay, a web3-native game launcher and aggregator of game stores. HyperPlay allows players to discover and install any game from the Epic Store, GOG, or HyperPlay's own store, and integrates with MetaMask and WalletConnect for simple in-game transactions, even in native desktop games. Both native desktop games and browser games are supported. Developers can implement in-game transactions, and are free from de-platforming and Apple-tax fees.|#BUIDLHub Mainstage|13:00|2023-02-28|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Building Interoperable Permissionless Games with HyperPlay (Workshop)&dates=20230228T130000Z-07:00/20230228T133000Z-07:00)|

|World Computer: Ethereum plus Internet Computer|Imagine a world where all internet applications and services exist fully on-the-blockchain—no centralized cloud computing services or server computers required. Imagine a world in which all internet assets, such as websites and applications, including mass market social media services and their data, enterprise solutions, etc., are hosted fully on-chain, where they are built exclusively from smart contracts, without need for Web2 integrations of any kind. This would be a great advance on prevailing Web3 and DeFi architectures that are often dependent on a variety of Web2 integrations—including the use of centralized cloud computing services such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services—to make their services available to end-users. The Internet Computer, however, is making these points of centralization obsolete for those building Web3 and DeFi to fully decentralize their systems—allowing for a truly decentralized Internet from end-to-end.

Ethereum and the Internet Computer network are a dream combination, which together can fully realize the World Computer vision. New cryptography enables code running on the two networks to be transparently integrated.

If you’re building Web3 services and are dependent on Web2 integrations of any kind (e.g. hosting a Web2 website to serve your products and services), come learn about how you can build your entire ecosystem fully-on-chain and free yourself from Web2! End-to-end decentralization is possible on the Internet Computer, including native integration with ECDSA tokens (e.g. ETH + BTC!) 

In this talk, Jan will address the SporkDAO community and other audience members on how the crypto community can build their products and services 100% on-chain without the need for Web2 integrations, go fully on-chain and fully realize the World Computer vision.|Decentralized Finance Stage|09:00|2023-03-04|[Add to Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=World Computer: Ethereum plus Internet Computer&dates=20230304T090000Z-07:00/20230304T092000Z-07:00)|
|Building a Sustainable Web3 Ecosystem with Two Treasury Solutions|The panel discussion will focus on the challenges of building sustainable Web3 ecosystems, which have been rapidly growing but currently face limitations. The current model of trying to solve both technology and ecosystem issues at the same time is not sustainable and results in exhausted resources. Panelists will discuss a new approach using a two treasury solution that separates infrastructure and ecosystem building. DAOs are prime examples as a unique solution for ecosystem building as they provide an open and inclusive decision-making process and allow token holders to actively participate in growth.

The panel will feature members of the BitDAO ecosystem sharing their expertise and experiences in building a decentralized ecosystem.

|Reserve Protocol - $70k Hackathon @ ETHDenver|Currently, there are 5 countries worldwide with an inflation rate higher than 100%. The cost of sending a $200 international remittance can be as high as $34. People have to rely on grey markets to get credit which can result in unfair loans, theft, harassment and physical harm. Meanwhile, centralized players in crypto have been plagued with non transparent fraudsters, most recently at Celsius and FTX. However, DeFi keeps working and its on-chain proof of reserves couldn't be more transparent. It’s clear that the need for safe, stable money has never been more important. Reserve Protocol lets anyone (that's YOU!) create baskets of asset-backed currencies (what we call RTokens) using anything in DeFi. We're celebrating Reserve's All-Clear milestone (passing many rigorous code audits) with over $70k in prizes and free lunch. Join us Mar 1st at The Red Barber from 10am-5pm. There are 2 hackathon categories: 1️⃣ RTokens pitch & adoption a) Pitch: create a deck and present on your innovative RToken idea b) Adoption: prizes for adoption of your deployed RToken 2️⃣ Collateral plugin development - build RToken plugins so others can use your favorite protocol's tokens as collateral on Reserve Interested?? Tell us about yourself and apply to attend.

|Casalinga di Voghera: How Web3 Will Change the Face of Public and Private Collaboration|The term "Voghera housewife" (Casalinga di Voghera) is often used in the media, political discourse and even in common parlance as a reference to the average, stereotypical, somewhat lower-middle-class person, voter or consumer. It is not a disparaging term but refers to an average person who – despite not being very educated or sophisticated – with hard work and self-sacrifice is trying to raise a family as best as possible. CGI Federal is trying to bring the average person into the discourse between federal agencies and commercial entities. The ideas of one can be mashed together with the ideas of many to create new ideas in real-time. It can be used to prevent pandemics, protect children from a live shooter in a school, and create discourse to avoid a war.

Not surprisingly, Web3 developers tend to gravitate toward using hosted blockchain gateways, aka RPC, solutions. Alas, "RPC as SaaS" introduces centralized bottlenecks challenging the availability, reliability and ethos of dApps.​​Fluence, a decentralized FaaS stack, provides a ready-to-use decentralized RPC (fRPC) solution to empower dApp developers to quickly and efficiently integrate decentralized RPC calls into their dApps. Moreover, USDC 11,000 are available to developers using and hacking on fRPC during the EthDenver 2023 hackathon.​​This workshop provides an overview of Fluence's open, decentralized FaaS protocol and available open source tooling. Moreover, we'll dive into the nitty gritty of fRPC and how to integrate fRP into your dApps.
